# Project Euler 73 Solution - Counting Fractions in a Range

<https://projecteuler.net/problem=73>:

* [73.py](73.py)

We need the number of reduced proper fractions `n/d` with `d ≤ 12000` that satisfy:

- `1/3 < n/d < 1/2`
- `gcd(n, d) = 1`

### Key observations

For a fixed denominator `d`, the valid numerators are exactly the integers `n` such that:

- `n/d > 1/3`  ⇒  `n > d/3`  ⇒  `n ≥ floor(d/3) + 1`
- `n/d < 1/2`  ⇒  `n < d/2`  ⇒  `n ≤ floor((d-1)/2)`

So for each `d`, we iterate `n` in:

```
n_start = d//3 + 1
n_end   = (d-1)//2
```

and count those with `gcd(n, d) = 1`.

### Complexity

The total number of `(n, d)` pairs checked is about:

\[
\sum_{d=1}^{N} \frac{d}{6} \approx \frac{N^2}{12}
\]

For `N = 12000`, this is ~12 million gcd checks, which runs quickly in PyPy3.

### Verification

The statement's example (`d ≤ 8`) is included as an `assert` and must return `3`.
