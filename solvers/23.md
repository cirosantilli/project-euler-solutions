## Key idea
We need the sum of all positive integers `n ≤ 28123` that **cannot** be written as the sum of two abundant numbers.

A number is **abundant** if the sum of its proper divisors is greater than the number.

## Approach
1. **Compute sum of proper divisors for every `n ≤ 28123`** using a sieve-like method:
   - For each divisor `d`, add `d` to all multiples `2d, 3d, ...`.
   - This gives `sum_proper_divisors[n]` for all `n` in about `O(N log N)` time.

2. **Collect all abundant numbers**:
   - `abundant = [n | sum_proper_divisors[n] > n]`.

3. **Mark all sums of two abundant numbers** up to the limit:
   - Use a `bytearray can` where `can[s] = 1` if `s` is representable.
   - For each abundant `a`, add it to abundant numbers `b ≥ a` and stop when `a + b > 28123`.

4. **Sum all numbers not marked**:
   - `answer = sum(n for n in 1..28123 if can[n] == 0)`.

## Complexity
- Divisor sieve: `O(N log N)` with `N = 28123`.
- Marking sums: roughly `O(A^2)` in the number of abundant values `A`, but with early breaks when sums exceed the limit; runs fast for this bound.

The program prints the final result.
