## Key idea
The ciphertext is produced by XOR-ing each plaintext ASCII byte with a repeating 3-character lowercase key.  
Since the key length is only 3 and each character is in `a..z`, there are only `26^3 = 17576` keys to try.

## Approach
1. **Load cipher bytes** from `0059_cipher.txt` (tries a few common paths); if unavailable, the program includes a fallback embedded copy.
2. **Brute-force all 3-letter lowercase keys**.
3. For each candidate key:
   - Decrypt on the fly using XOR with the repeating key.
   - Reject the key immediately if any decrypted byte is not printable ASCII (plus newline/carriage return).
   - Compute a simple **English-likeness score** based on spaces and common letter frequencies.
4. Select the key with the best score and output the **sum of ASCII codes** of the decrypted plaintext.

## Complexity
- `17576` keys × `~1500` bytes ≈ 26 million XOR/score steps → runs comfortably in seconds on PyPy3.

## Output
Prints a single integer: the sum of ASCII values of the decrypted message.
