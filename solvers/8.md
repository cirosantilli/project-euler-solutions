# Project Euler 8 Solution - Largest Product in a Series

* [8.py](8.py)

## Key idea
A sliding window product works, but zeros break the ability to divide out the outgoing digit safely.

## Approach
1. Convert the 1000-digit number into an array of digits.
2. Split the digit array into maximal contiguous segments that contain **no zeros**.
   - Any window containing a zero has product 0, so it can never beat a positive maximum.
3. For each zero-free segment of length `>= k`:
   - Compute the product of the first `k` digits.
   - Slide the window by one position at a time using:
     - `prod = (prod // outgoing_digit) * incoming_digit`
4. Track the maximum product across all segments.

## Complexity
- Time: `O(n)` where `n = 1000`
- Space: `O(n)` for the digit list

The code includes the statement's example assertion (`k=4` gives `5832`) and prints the result for `k=13`.
