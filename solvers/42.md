## Idea
1. Compute each word’s **word value** by mapping `A..Z -> 1..26` and summing letter values.
2. A value `x` is a **triangle number** iff there exists an integer `n` such that:
   \[
   \frac{n(n+1)}{2} = x \;\;\Longleftrightarrow\;\; n^2 + n - 2x = 0
   \]
   The discriminant must be a perfect square:
   \[
   D = 1 + 8x
   \]
   and `n = (sqrt(D) - 1) / 2` must be an integer.
3. Parse the provided `0042_words.txt` (CSV-like: `"WORD1","WORD2",...`), compute values, and count how many are triangular.

## Complexity
Let `L` be the total number of letters across all words.  
- Time: `O(L)` (each word is processed once, each check is `O(1)` using integer sqrt)
- Memory: `O(1)` besides storing the words list from the file.

## Tests included
- First 10 triangle numbers match the statement.
- `SKY` has value `55`, which is a triangle number.
