# Project Euler 39 Solution - Integer Right Triangles

* [39.py](39.py)

We want the perimeter `p ≤ 1000` that yields the most integer right-triangle solutions `(a, b, c)` with
`a² + b² = c²` and `a + b + c = p`.

## Key idea (avoid brute force)
All integer right triangles come from **Euclid’s formula**:

For integers `m > n`:
- `a = m² - n²`
- `b = 2mn`
- `c = m² + n²`

This generates a **primitive** triple exactly when:
- `gcd(m, n) = 1` (coprime)
- `m` and `n` have opposite parity

The perimeter of the primitive triple is:
- `p0 = a + b + c = 2m(m + n)`

All non-primitive solutions are multiples of a primitive one:
- perimeter `p = k * p0` for integer `k ≥ 1`

## Algorithm
1. For each valid `(m, n)` producing a primitive triple, compute `p0 = 2m(m+n)`.
2. For each multiple `k*p0 ≤ 1000`, increment a counter for that perimeter.
3. Pick the perimeter with the maximum count.

`m` only needs to go up to where the smallest possible `p0 = 2m(m+1)` exceeds 1000, so the loop is tiny.

## Result
The perimeter `p ≤ 1000` with the maximum number of solutions is:
- **840**
