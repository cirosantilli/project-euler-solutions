Add asserts for the test cases given in the problem statement if any, and a print with the final result at the end. Your code must run in a few minutes at most, usually a few seconds. Don't try to brute force the solution, only use brute forcing if needed to better understand the problem on small instances. Don't use external libraries, only the Python standard library. Don't use multithreading, only a single CPU core. Use typing for function signatures.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n\nmain.py\n\n<Python implementation>\n\nREADME.md\n\n<Markdown summary of the reasoning/insights used (high level; no chain-of-thought)>\n\nPROBLEM\n\n# Totient Maximum\n\nEuler's totient function, $\\phi(n)$ [sometimes called the phi function], is defined as the number of positive integers not exceeding $n$ which are relatively prime to $n$. For example, as $1$, $2$, $4$, $5$, $7$, and $8$, are all less than or equal to nine and relatively prime to nine, $\\phi(9)=6$.\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **$n$** | **Relatively Prime** | **$\\phi(n)$** | **$n/\\phi(n)$** |\n| 2 | 1 | 1 | 2 |\n| 3 | 1,2 | 2 | 1.5 |\n| 4 | 1,3 | 2 | 2 |\n| 5 | 1,2,3,4 | 4 | 1.25 |\n| 6 | 1,5 | 2 | 3 |\n| 7 | 1,2,3,4,5,6 | 6 | 1.1666... |\n| 8 | 1,3,5,7 | 4 | 2 |\n| 9 | 1,2,4,5,7,8 | 6 | 1.5 |\n| 10 | 1,3,7,9 | 4 | 2.5 |\n\nIt can be seen that $n = 6$ produces a maximum $n/\\phi(n)$ for $n\\leq 10$.\n\nFind the value of $n\\leq 1\\,000\\,000$ for which $n/\\phi(n)$ is a maximum.\n",
