Add asserts for the test cases given in the problem statement if any, and a print with the final result at the end. Your code must run in a few minutes at most, usually a few seconds. Don't try to brute force the solution, only use brute forcing if needed to better understand the problem on small instances. Don't use external libraries, only the Python standard library. Don't use multithreading, only a single CPU core. Use typing for function signatures.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n\nmain.py\n\n<Python implementation>\n\nREADME.md\n\n<Markdown summary of the reasoning/insights used (high level; no chain-of-thought)>\n\nPROBLEM\n\n# Singular Integer Right Triangles\n\nIt turns out that $\\pu{12 cm}$ is the smallest length of wire that can be bent to form an integer sided right angle triangle in exactly one way, but there are many more examples.\n\n* $\\pu{\\mathbf{12} \\mathbf{cm}}$: $(3,4,5)$\n* $\\pu{\\mathbf{24} \\mathbf{cm}}$: $(6,8,10)$\n* $\\pu{\\mathbf{30} \\mathbf{cm}}$: $(5,12,13)$\n* $\\pu{\\mathbf{36} \\mathbf{cm}}$: $(9,12,15)$\n* $\\pu{\\mathbf{40} \\mathbf{cm}}$: $(8,15,17)$\n* $\\pu{\\mathbf{48} \\mathbf{cm}}$: $(12,16,20)$\n\nIn contrast, some lengths of wire, like $\\pu{20 cm}$, cannot be bent to form an integer sided right angle triangle, and other lengths allow more than one solution to be found; for example, using $\\pu{120 cm}$ it is possible to form exactly three different integer sided right angle triangles.\n\n* $\\pu{\\mathbf{120} \\mathbf{cm}}$: $(30,40,50)$, $(20,48,52)$, $(24,45,51)$\n\nGiven that $L$ is the length of the wire, for how many values of $L \\le 1\\,500\\,000$ can exactly one integer sided right angle triangle be formed?\n",
