Project Euler 581: 47-smooth triangular numbers

A number is p-smooth if it has no prime factors larger than p.
Let T(n) = n(n+1)/2 be the nth triangular number.
We need the sum of all indices n such that T(n) is 47-smooth.

Key observation:
    gcd(n, n+1) = 1
So T(n) is 47-smooth  <=>  n and n+1 are both 47-smooth.
Therefore, the task becomes:
    Sum all n for which (n, n+1) is a consecutive pair of 47-smooth numbers.

Størmer's theorem implies there are only finitely many consecutive pairs of P-smooth numbers
for any finite prime set P containing 2. For P = primes <= 47, the largest number appearing
in any consecutive pair is 1109496723126 (OEIS A117581, 15th term).
So it's sufficient to generate all 47-smooth numbers up to that limit and look for neighbors
that differ by 1.

Implementation:
    Generate all P-smooth numbers up to LIMIT in increasing order using a generalized
    Hamming-number ("ugly number") multi-pointer method (no heap, no external libraries).
    While generating, whenever the current smooth number is exactly 1 greater than the
    previous smooth number, add the previous one to the answer.
