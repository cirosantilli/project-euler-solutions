## Key idea
A prime is *truncatable* if repeatedly removing digits from:
- left to right **and**
- right to left

always produces primes at every intermediate step. Single-digit primes (2, 3, 5, 7) are excluded.

## Approach
1. Use a sieve of Eratosthenes up to `1_000_000` to get O(1) primality checks.
   - This bound is sufficient because the largest truncatable prime is below one million.
2. Iterate through odd numbers ≥ 11:
   - If the number is prime, test truncatability by converting it to a string and checking all left and right truncations via the sieve.
3. Collect exactly 11 such primes and sum them.

## Complexity
- Sieve: `O(N log log N)` with `N = 1,000,000`
- Checking truncations: at most ~6 truncations per candidate in this range
- Runs in well under a second on typical machines (PyPy3).

The program prints the final sum.
