# Project Euler 551 Solution - Sum of Digits Sequence

<https://projecteuler.net/problem=551>:

* [551.py](551.py)

## Key observation

The problem defines:

- `a0 = 1`
- for `n ≥ 1`, `a_n` is the **sum of the digits of all preceding terms**.

Let `s(x)` be the sum of decimal digits of `x`.

Because `a_n = s(a0) + s(a1) + … + s(a_{n-1})`, we get an immediate one-step recurrence:

- `a_{n+1} = a_n + s(a_n)` for `n ≥ 1`

This turns the original “sum over all previous terms” definition into a simple iterative update.

## Fast digit-sum computation

Computing `s(x)` with repeated `% 10` and `// 10` is already fine for moderate `n`, but we speed it up further with a small lookup table:

- Precompute digit sums for all values `0..9999`
- Compute `s(x)` by repeatedly taking `x % 10000` chunks and summing the table entries

This reduces the number of expensive divisions/mods.

## Verification

The implementation includes assertions for the values given in the problem statement:

- Initial terms: `1, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 23, 28, 38, 49, …`
- `a_{10^6} = 31054319`

## Output

Running `main.py` prints `a_{10^15}`.
