Add asserts for the test cases given in the problem statement if any, and a print with the final result at the end. Your code must run in a few minutes at most, usually a few seconds. Don't try to brute force the solution, only use brute forcing if needed to better understand the problem on small instances. Don't use external libraries, only the Python standard library. Don't use multithreading, only a single CPU core. Use typing for function signatures.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n\nmain.py\n\n<Python implementation>\n\nREADME.md\n\n<Markdown summary of the reasoning/insights used (high level; no chain-of-thought)>\n\nPROBLEM\n\n# Product-sum Numbers\n\nA natural number, $N$, that can be written as the sum and product of a given set of at least two natural numbers, $\\{a\\_1, a\\_2, \\dots, a\\_k\\}$ is called a product-sum number: $N = a\\_1 + a\\_2 + \\cdots + a\\_k = a\\_1 \\times a\\_2 \\times \\cdots \\times a\\_k$.\n\nFor example, $6 = 1 + 2 + 3 = 1 \\times 2 \\times 3$.\n\nFor a given set of size, $k$, we shall call the smallest $N$ with this property a minimal product-sum number. The minimal product-sum numbers for sets of size, $k = 2, 3, 4, 5$, and $6$ are as follows.\n\n* $k=2$: $4 = 2 \\times 2 = 2 + 2$\n* $k=3$: $6 = 1 \\times 2 \\times 3 = 1 + 2 + 3$\n* $k=4$: $8 = 1 \\times 1 \\times 2 \\times 4 = 1 + 1 + 2 + 4$\n* $k=5$: $8 = 1 \\times 1 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2$\n* $k=6$: $12 = 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 \\times 2 \\times 6 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 6$\n\nHence for $2 \\le k \\le 6$, the sum of all the minimal product-sum numbers is $4+6+8+12 = 30$; note that $8$ is only counted once in the sum.\n\nIn fact, as the complete set of minimal product-sum numbers for $2 \\le k \\le 12$ is $\\{4, 6, 8, 12, 15, 16\\}$, the sum is $61$.\n\nWhat is the sum of all the minimal product-sum numbers for $2 \\le k \\le 12000$?\n",
