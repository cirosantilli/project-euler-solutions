We need all integers equal to the sum of the factorials of their decimal digits, excluding 1 and 2, and then sum them.

### Key insights
- Precompute `0!` through `9!` once.
- For an `n`-digit number, the maximum possible digit-factorial sum is `n * 9!`.
- Once `n * 9! < 10^(n-1)`, no `n`-digit number can be reached by any digit-factorial sum, so we have a finite search bound.
- This bound yields a maximum of 7 digits, so the search only needs to go up to `7 * 9! = 2,540,160`.

### Approach
1. Precompute digit factorials in an array `facts[0..9]`.
2. Compute the upper bound using the inequality above.
3. For each number `x` from 3 to `upper`, compute the sum of factorials of its digits and check if it equals `x`.
4. Accumulate the sum of all such numbers and print it.

The resulting sum is `40730`.
