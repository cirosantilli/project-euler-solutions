# Project Euler 102 Solution - Triangle Containment

* [102.py](102.py)

## Idea
A point is inside a triangle iff it lies on the same side of all three directed edges.

For triangle vertices `A, B, C` and point `P` (here `P = (0,0)`), compute the signed areas / cross products:

- `s1 = cross(B-A, P-A)`
- `s2 = cross(C-B, P-B)`
- `s3 = cross(A-C, P-C)`

If `s1, s2, s3` are all positive or all negative, then `P` is inside the triangle.
To enforce **strictly inside**, any zero cross product (point on an edge) is rejected.

## Implementation
- Read `0102_triangles.txt` (each line has 6 comma-separated integers: `x1,y1,x2,y2,x3,y3`)
- For each triangle, apply the cross-product sign test against the origin
- Count how many triangles contain the origin and print the count

The two example triangles from the statement are included as `assert` tests.
