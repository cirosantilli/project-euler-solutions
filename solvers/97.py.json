Add asserts for the test cases given in the problem statement if any, and a print with the final result at the end. Your code must run in a few minutes at most, usually a few seconds. Don't try to brute force the solution, only use brute forcing if needed to better understand the problem on small instances. Don't use external libraries, only the Python standard library. Don't use multithreading, only a single CPU core. Use typing for function signatures.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n\nmain.py\n\n<Python implementation>\n\nREADME.md\n\n<Markdown summary of the reasoning/insights used (high level; no chain-of-thought)>\n\nPROBLEM\n\n# Large Non-Mersenne Prime\n\nThe first known prime found to exceed one million digits was discovered in 1999, and is a Mersenne prime of the form $2^{6972593} - 1$; it contains exactly $2\\,098\\,960$ digits. Subsequently other Mersenne primes, of the form $2^p - 1$, have been found which contain more digits.\n\nHowever, in 2004 there was found a massive non-Mersenne prime which contains $2\\,357\\,207$ digits: $28433 \\times 2^{7830457} + 1$.\n\nFind the last ten digits of this prime number.\n",
