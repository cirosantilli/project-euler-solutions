Add asserts for the test cases given in the problem statement if any, and a print with the final result at the end. Your code must run in a few minutes at most, usually a few seconds. Don't try to brute force the solution, only use brute forcing if needed to better understand the problem on small instances. Don't use external libraries, only the Python standard library. Don't use multithreading, only a single CPU core. Use typing for function signatures.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n\nmain.py\n\n<Python implementation>\n\nREADME.md\n\n<Markdown summary of the reasoning/insights used (high level; no chain-of-thought)>\n\nPROBLEM\n\n# Digit Cancelling Fractions\n\nThe fraction $49/98$ is a curious fraction, as an inexperienced mathematician in attempting to simplify it may incorrectly believe that $49/98 = 4/8$, which is correct, is obtained by cancelling the $9$s.\n\nWe shall consider fractions like, $30/50 = 3/5$, to be trivial examples.\n\nThere are exactly four non-trivial examples of this type of fraction, less than one in value, and containing two digits in the numerator and denominator.\n\nIf the product of these four fractions is given in its lowest common terms, find the value of the denominator.\n",
