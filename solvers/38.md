# Project Euler 38 Solution - Pandigital Multiples

<https://projecteuler.net/problem=38>:

* [38.py](38.py)

We seek the largest 9-digit number that is a concatenation of `x*1, x*2, ..., x*n` for some integer `x` and `n > 1`, and is 1–9 pandigital (uses each digit 1..9 exactly once, no zero).

### Key observations
- The concatenation must be exactly 9 digits long.
- If `x` has 5 or more digits, then `x*1` has at least 5 digits and `x*2` has at least 5 digits, so concatenating two terms already yields 10+ digits. Therefore `x <= 9999`.
- For each `x` in `1..9999`, we build the concatenated product incrementally until length is at least 9:
  - If length becomes exactly 9 and `n > 1`, test pandigitality.
  - Track the maximum numeric value found.

### Pandigitality check
Use a bitmask over digits 1..9:
- Reject any `0`.
- Reject repeated digits.
- Accept if the final mask equals the target mask for digits 1..9.

This runs very fast (only 9999 candidates, each building a short string).
The resulting maximum is `932718654`.
