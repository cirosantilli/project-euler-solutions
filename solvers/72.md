A reduced proper fraction `n/d` (with `n < d` and `gcd(n, d) = 1`) is counted by its denominator `d`.

For a fixed denominator `d`, the number of integers `n` with `1 <= n < d` and `gcd(n, d) = 1` is exactly **Euler’s totient function** `φ(d)`.

Therefore, the total number of reduced proper fractions with `d <= N` is:

\[
\sum_{d=2}^{N} \varphi(d)
\]

## Approach

1. Compute `φ(d)` for all `d <= 1,000,000` efficiently using a **linear sieve** (O(N)).
2. Sum `φ(d)` for `d = 2..N`.

This avoids generating or sorting any fractions and runs quickly within limits.
