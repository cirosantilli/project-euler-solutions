Add asserts for the test cases given in the problem statement if any, and a print with the final result at the end. Your code must run in a few minutes at most, usually a few seconds. Don't try to brute force the solution, only use brute forcing if needed to better understand the problem on small instances. Don't use external libraries, only the Python standard library. Don't use multithreading, only a single CPU core. Use typing for function signatures.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n\nmain.py\n\n<Python implementation>\n\nREADME.md\n\n<Markdown summary of the reasoning/insights used (high level; no chain-of-thought)>\n\nPROBLEM\n\n# Counting Sundays\n\nYou are given the following information, but you may prefer to do some research for yourself.\n\n* 1 Jan 1900 was a Monday.\n* Thirty days has September,  \n  April, June and November.  \n  All the rest have thirty-one,  \n  Saving February alone,  \n  Which has twenty-eight, rain or shine.  \n  And on leap years, twenty-nine.\n* A leap year occurs on any year evenly divisible by 4, but not on a century unless it is divisible by 400.\n\nHow many Sundays fell on the first of the month during the twentieth century (1 Jan 1901 to 31 Dec 2000)?\n",
