Add asserts for the test cases given in the problem statement if any, and a print with the final result at the end. Your code must run in a few minutes at most, usually a few seconds. Don't try to brute force the solution, only use brute forcing if needed to better understand the problem on small instances. Don't use external libraries, only the Python standard library. Don't use multithreading, only a single CPU core. Use typing for function signatures. Also produce a markdown file README.md summarizing the main ideas used.\n\nPROBLEM\n\n# Last Digits of Divisors\n\nFor a positive integer $n$ and digits $d$, we define $F(n, d)$ as the number of the divisors of $n$ whose last digits equal $d$.  \nFor example, $F(84, 4) = 3$. Among the divisors of $84$ ($1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 12, 14, 21, 28, 42, 84$), three of them ($4, 14, 84$) have the last digit $4$.\n\nWe can also verify that $F(12!, 12) = 11$ and $F(50!, 123) = 17888$.\n\nFind $F(10^6!, 65432)$ modulo ($10^{16} + 61$).",
