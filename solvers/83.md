We need the minimum-cost path from the top-left cell to the bottom-right cell in a grid, where moves are allowed in four directions (up/down/left/right). Each cell value is a non-negative cost, and the path sum includes both the starting and ending cells.

### Key insight
This is a shortest-path problem on a weighted graph:
- Each grid cell is a node.
- Edges connect adjacent cells (4-neighborhood).
- Moving into a neighbor adds the neighbor cell's value to the total cost.
- Start distance is the value of the top-left cell.

Because all edge weights are non-negative, Dijkstra’s algorithm finds the optimal path efficiently.

### Approach
- Parse the matrix (CSV per row).
- Run Dijkstra with a priority queue (`heapq`) over the `N*M` nodes.
- Maintain a distance array and a visited array.
- Stop as soon as the bottom-right node is finalized (popped as the smallest unvisited distance).

### Complexity
For an `80x80` grid (6400 nodes), Dijkstra runs very fast:
- Time: `O(V log V + E log V)` with `E ≈ 4V`
- Memory: `O(V)`
