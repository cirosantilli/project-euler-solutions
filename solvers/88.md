# Project Euler 88 Solution - Product-sum Numbers

* [88.py](88.py)

A number `N` is a product-sum number for a multiset of `k` natural numbers if:
`N = sum(a_i) = product(a_i)`.

Key trick:
- Enumerate only factors `>= 2` (ignore `1`s during search).
- For any factor multiset with:
  - product `P`
  - sum `S`
  - number of factors `t`
- We can add exactly `(P - S)` ones to make the total sum equal to `P` without changing the product.
- That yields an effective set size:
  `k = t + (P - S)`.

So, for each factor combination we compute `k` and update the minimal `P` for that `k`.

### Enumeration
We perform a DFS generating factor combinations in nondecreasing order to avoid duplicates.
We also use a known safe upper bound: minimal product-sum numbers for `k <= K` are `<= 2K`,
so we only explore products up to `2K`.

### Result
After filling the minimal value for each `k` in `[2..K]`, we take the set of these minimal values
(duplicates removed) and sum them.

The code includes asserts for the examples:
- `K=6  -> 30`
- `K=12 -> 61`

Finally it prints the answer for `K=12000`.
