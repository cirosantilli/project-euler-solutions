Add asserts for the test cases given in the problem statement if any, and a print with the final result at the end. Your code must run in a few minutes at most, usually a few seconds. Don't try to brute force the solution, only use brute forcing if needed to better understand the problem on small instances. Don't use external libraries, only the Python standard library. Don't use multithreading, only a single CPU core. Use typing for function signatures.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n\nmain.py\n\n<Python implementation>\n\nREADME.md\n\n<Markdown summary of the reasoning/insights used (high level; no chain-of-thought)>\n\nPROBLEM\n\n# Digit Factorial Chains\n\nThe number $145$ is well known for the property that the sum of the factorial of its digits is equal to $145$:\n$$1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145.$$\n\nPerhaps less well known is $169$, in that it produces the longest chain of numbers that link back to $169$; it turns out that there are only three such loops that exist:\n\n$$\\begin{align}\n&169 \\to 363601 \\to 1454 \\to 169\\\\\n&871 \\to 45361 \\to 871\\\\\n&872 \\to 45362 \\to 872\n\\end{align}$$\n\nIt is not difficult to prove that EVERY starting number will eventually get stuck in a loop. For example,\n\n$$\\begin{align}\n&69 \\to 363600 \\to 1454 \\to 169 \\to 363601 (\\to 1454)\\\\\n&78 \\to 45360 \\to 871 \\to 45361 (\\to 871)\\\\\n&540 \\to 145 (\\to 145)\n\\end{align}$$\n\nStarting with $69$ produces a chain of five non-repeating terms, but the longest non-repeating chain with a starting number below one million is sixty terms.\n\nHow many chains, with a starting number below one million, contain exactly sixty non-repeating terms?\n",
