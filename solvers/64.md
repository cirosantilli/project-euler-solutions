# Project Euler 64 Solution - Odd Period Square Roots

* [64.py](64.py)

For each non-square integer `N`, the continued fraction of `sqrt(N)` is periodic.  
To find the period length efficiently, use the standard recurrence:

- `a0 = floor(sqrt(N))`
- Initialize `m = 0`, `d = 1`, `a = a0`
- Repeat:
  - `m = d*a - m`
  - `d = (N - m*m) / d`
  - `a = floor((a0 + m) / d)`
  - count steps as the period length

For square roots, the period completes when `a` becomes `2*a0`.  
We compute this period length for each `N <= 10000` (skipping perfect squares) and count how many periods are odd.

The program includes the given check: for `N <= 13`, the number of odd periods is `4`.
