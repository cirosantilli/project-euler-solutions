Add asserts for the test cases given in the problem statement if any, and a print with the final result at the end. Your code must run in a few minutes at most, usually a few seconds. Don't try to brute force the solution, only use brute forcing if needed to better understand the problem on small instances. Don't use external libraries, only the Python standard library. Don't use multithreading, only a single CPU core. Use typing for function signatures.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n\nmain.py\n\n<Python implementation>\n\nREADME.md\n\n<Markdown summary of the reasoning/insights used (high level; no chain-of-thought)>\n\nPROBLEM\n\n# Coin Partitions\n\nLet $p(n)$ represent the number of different ways in which $n$ coins can be separated into piles. For example, five coins can be separated into piles in exactly seven different ways, so $p(5)=7$.\n\nOOOOO  \nOOOO\u00a0 \u00a0O  \nOOO\u00a0 \u00a0OO  \nOOO\u00a0 \u00a0O\u00a0 \u00a0O  \nOO\u00a0 \u00a0OO\u00a0 \u00a0O  \nOO\u00a0 \u00a0O\u00a0 \u00a0O\u00a0 \u00a0O  \nO\u00a0 \u00a0O\u00a0 \u00a0O\u00a0 \u00a0O\u00a0 \u00a0O\n\nFind the least value of $n$ for which $p(n)$ is divisible by one million.\n",
