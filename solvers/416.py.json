Add asserts for the test cases given in the problem statement if any, and a print with the final result at the end. Your code must run in a few minutes at most, usually a few seconds. Don't try to brute force the solution, only use brute forcing if needed to better understand the problem on small instances. Don't use external libraries, only the Python standard library. Don't use multithreading, only a single CPU core. Use typing for function signatures. Also produce a markdown file README.md summarizing the main ideas used.\n\nPROBLEM\n\n# A Frog's Trip\n\nA row of $n$ squares contains a frog in the leftmost square. By successive jumps the frog goes to the rightmost square and then back to the leftmost square. On the outward trip he jumps one, two or three squares to the right, and on the homeward trip he jumps to the left in a similar manner. He cannot jump outside the squares. He repeats the round-trip travel $m$ times.\n\nLet $F(m, n)$ be the number of the ways the frog can travel so that at most one square remains unvisited.  \nFor example, $F(1, 3) = 4$, $F(1, 4) = 15$, $F(1, 5) = 46$, $F(2, 3) = 16$ and $F(2, 100) \\bmod 10^9 = 429619151$.\n\nFind the last $9$ digits of $F(10, 10^{12})$.",
