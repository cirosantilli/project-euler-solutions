* [43.py](43.py)

We need all 0–9 pandigital 10-digit numbers `d1..d10` such that:

- `d2d3d4` divisible by 2
- `d3d4d5` divisible by 3
- `d4d5d6` divisible by 5
- `d5d6d7` divisible by 7
- `d6d7d8` divisible by 11
- `d7d8d9` divisible by 13
- `d8d9d10` divisible by 17

### Key idea: build from the right using overlaps
Each constraint involves a 3-digit block, and consecutive blocks overlap by two digits.  
So we can construct valid numbers from right to left:

1. Enumerate all 3-digit multiples of 17 (with leading zeros allowed) with distinct digits → possible `(d8,d9,d10)`.
2. Extend leftwards one digit at a time using primes 13, 11, 7, 5, 3, 2:
   - If we currently have a suffix starting with `(b,c,...)`, then the next digit `a` must make `abc` divisible by the current prime.
   - Maintain a bitmask of used digits to enforce global uniqueness.
3. After building `d2..d10`, exactly one digit remains for `d1`; it must not be 0 (no leading zero).

This prunes the search heavily (only a few hundred states) and runs very fast.

The program also asserts the example `1406357289` satisfies the property and asserts the known final sum `16695334890`.
