# Project Euler 24 Solution - Lexicographic Permutations

* [24.py](24.py)

To find the millionth lexicographic permutation of digits `0..9` efficiently, we avoid generating all `10! = 3,628,800` permutations.

## Key idea: Factorial Number System (ranking/unranking permutations)

In lexicographic order, permutations are grouped in blocks:

- With `k` remaining digits, each fixed first digit accounts for `(k-1)!` permutations.
- The index of the next digit is determined by integer division:
  - `idx = rank // (k-1)!`
  - Update `rank = rank % (k-1)!`
- Remove the chosen digit from the available list and continue.

We treat the target as 1-indexed (`1,000,000`), convert to 0-indexed rank (`999,999`), and build the permutation digit by digit.

## Complexity

- Time: `O(k^2)` due to list removals (`k=10`, trivial).
- Space: `O(k)`.

## Result

The millionth lexicographic permutation of `0..9` is:

`2783915460`
