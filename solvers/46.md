We need the smallest odd composite `n` that **cannot** be expressed as:

`n = p + 2*s^2` where `p` is prime and `s` is an integer.

### Approach
1. Iterate through odd numbers starting from 9.
2. Skip primes (we only care about odd composites).
3. For each odd composite `n`, try all primes `p < n`:
   - Let `rem = n - p`. If `rem` is even, check whether `rem/2` is a perfect square using integer square root.
4. The first `n` that fails for all primes is the answer.

### Efficiency
This is fast because:
- The answer is small (5777).
- Prime checks use trial division by already-known primes.
- Perfect-square checks use `math.isqrt` in O(1).

The program also includes asserts verifying the examples provided in the statement.
