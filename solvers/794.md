# Project Euler 794 Solution - Seventeen Points

<https://projecteuler.net/problem=794>:

* [794.py](794.py)

This repository contains a small, self‑contained Python program (`main.py`) that computes **F(17)** for Project Euler problem 794, printing the result rounded to 12 decimal places.

## Main ideas

### 1) Replace geometry with ranks (insertion history)
At step **n**, the first **n** points must hit each interval:

- `[0, 1/n)`, `[1/n, 2/n)`, …, `[(n-1)/n, 1)`

exactly once.

If you sort the first **n** points, then the **k**‑th smallest point must lie in the **k**‑th interval `\[k/n, (k+1)/n)` (because the intervals are ordered and disjoint).  
So the procedure is completely determined by, at each step, **where the new point is inserted** among the already‑sorted points.

### 2) Turn “choose a real number” into interval intersection
For a fixed insertion history, every point accumulates constraints of the form:

- `x ∈ [k/n, (k+1)/n)`

for each later step `n` in which it participates.

The feasible set for each point is the intersection of those half‑open intervals.  
To minimize the total sum, you take each point **as small as possible**, i.e. at the maximum of its lower bounds.

### 3) Exact arithmetic via a common denominator
All interval boundaries are rationals `k/n` with small `n`.  
We scale everything by:

- `D = lcm(1..max_n)`

so each boundary becomes an integer `k * (D/n)` and all comparisons are exact integer comparisons.

### 4) Depth‑first search (DFS) over insertion positions
The program DFS-es over all possible insertion positions, pruning only when any point’s feasible interval becomes empty (`lower >= upper`).  
It searches up to `n = 18` to also verify the statement that the construction cannot be extended beyond 17 points.

## Running

```bash
python3 main.py
```

The program prints the required value for **F(17)** to 12 decimal places.
