For each `n` from 1 to 100 that is **not** a perfect square, we need the sum of the first 100 digits of `√n` (written as a digit string with the decimal point removed).

Key idea: avoid floating point entirely by using integer arithmetic.

## Integer scaling trick

For `1 ≤ n ≤ 99`, we have `√n < 10`, so the first 100 digits are:
- 1 digit from the integer part, plus
- the next 99 digits after the decimal point.

That is exactly the digits of:

`floor( √n * 10^99 )`

Compute this with an integer square root:

`floor( √n * 10^99 ) = isqrt( n * 10^(2*99) ) = isqrt( n * 10^198 )`

Python's `math.isqrt` computes the integer square root efficiently for big integers.

## Procedure

1. Skip perfect squares (1, 4, 9, ..., 100).
2. For each remaining `n`:
   - Compute `isqrt(n * 10^198)`, which is a 100-digit integer.
   - Sum its digits.
3. Sum these digit sums over all irrational square roots.

Includes assertions for:
- the provided example (`n=2` gives 475),
- the known final total (40886).
