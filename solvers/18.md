# Project Euler 18 Solution - Maximum Path Sum I

<https://projecteuler.net/problem=18>:

* [18.py](18.py)

## Key idea
Use dynamic programming from the bottom of the triangle upward.

For each cell `(r, c)`, the best total from that cell to the bottom is:
- `triangle[r][c] + max(best_below[c], best_below[c+1])`

Starting with the last row as the initial `best_below`, we combine rows upward until only the top value remains. This yields the maximum top-to-bottom path sum in `O(n^2)` time and `O(n)` extra space.

## Validation
Includes an `assert` for the sample triangle where the maximum total is `23`.

## Output
The program prints the maximum total for the provided 15-row triangle.
