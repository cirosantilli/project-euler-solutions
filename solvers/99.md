To compare values of the form `base^exp` without computing enormous integers, use logarithms:

- `log(base^exp) = exp * log(base)`
- Since `log` is strictly increasing, comparing `base1^exp1` vs `base2^exp2` is equivalent to comparing:
  - `exp1 * log(base1)` vs `exp2 * log(base2)`

Algorithm:
1. Read all `(base, exponent)` pairs from the input file.
2. For each line `i`, compute `score = exponent * ln(base)` (a floating-point value).
3. Track the line with the maximum score.
4. Output that 1-based line number.

This runs in `O(n)` time for `n=1000` lines and avoids any big-integer exponentiation.
