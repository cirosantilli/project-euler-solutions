Add asserts for the test cases given in the problem statement if any, and a print with the final result at the end. Your code must run in a few minutes at most, usually a few seconds. Don't try to brute force the solution, only use brute forcing if needed to better understand the problem on small instances. Don't use external libraries, only the Python standard library. Don't use multithreading, only a single CPU core. Use typing for function signatures.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n\nmain.py\n\n<Python implementation>\n\nREADME.md\n\n<Markdown summary of the reasoning/insights used (high level; no chain-of-thought)>\n\nPROBLEM\n\n# Cube Digit Pairs\n\nEach of the six faces on a cube has a different digit ($0$ to $9$) written on it; the same is done to a second cube. By placing the two cubes side-by-side in different positions we can form a variety of $2$-digit numbers.\n\nFor example, the square number $64$ could be formed:\n\n![](resources/images/0090.png?1678992052)\n\nIn fact, by carefully choosing the digits on both cubes it is possible to display all of the square numbers below one-hundred: $01$, $04$, $09$, $16$, $25$, $36$, $49$, $64$, and $81$.\n\nFor example, one way this can be achieved is by placing $\\{0, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\\}$ on one cube and $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9\\}$ on the other cube.\n\nHowever, for this problem we shall allow the $6$ or $9$ to be turned upside-down so that an arrangement like $\\{0, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\\}$ and $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7\\}$ allows for all nine square numbers to be displayed; otherwise it would be impossible to obtain $09$.\n\nIn determining a distinct arrangement we are interested in the digits on each cube, not the order.\n\n* $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$ is equivalent to $\\{3, 6, 4, 1, 2, 5\\}$\n* $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$ is distinct from $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$\n\nBut because we are allowing $6$ and $9$ to be reversed, the two distinct sets in the last example both represent the extended set $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9\\}$ for the purpose of forming $2$-digit numbers.\n\nHow many distinct arrangements of the two cubes allow for all of the square numbers to be displayed?\n",
