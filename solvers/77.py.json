Add asserts for the test cases given in the problem statement if any, and a print with the final result at the end. Your code must run in a few minutes at most, usually a few seconds. Don't try to brute force the solution, only use brute forcing if needed to better understand the problem on small instances. Don't use external libraries, only the Python standard library. Don't use multithreading, only a single CPU core. Use typing for function signatures.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n\nmain.py\n\n<Python implementation>\n\nREADME.md\n\n<Markdown summary of the reasoning/insights used (high level; no chain-of-thought)>\n\nPROBLEM\n\n# Prime Summations\n\nIt is possible to write ten as the sum of primes in exactly five different ways:\n\n$$\\begin{align}\n&7 + 3\\\\\n&5 + 5\\\\\n&5 + 3 + 2\\\\\n&3 + 3 + 2 + 2\\\\\n&2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2\n\\end{align}$$\n\nWhat is the first value which can be written as the sum of primes in over five thousand different ways?\n",
