# Project Euler 63 Solution - Powerful Digit Counts

* [63.py](63.py)

We want to count positive integers that have exactly `n` decimal digits and are also an `n`th power, i.e. numbers of the form `a^n` whose digit count equals `n`.

Key observations:
- If `a >= 10`, then `a^n >= 10^n`, which has `n+1` digits, so it can never have exactly `n` digits.
  Therefore, only bases `a = 1..9` need to be checked.
- For increasing `n`, the maximum candidate is `9^n`. Once `9^n` has fewer than `n` digits, no `a^n` can have `n` digits for that (or any larger) `n`, so we can stop.

Algorithm:
- For `n = 1, 2, ...`, while `len(str(9^n)) >= n`:
  - For each `a` in `1..9`, check whether `len(str(a^n)) == n` and count it.
- Print the total.

This is very fast because it checks at most a few dozen `n` values and only 9 bases each time.
