# Project Euler 69 Solution - Totient Maximum

We want to maximize \( \frac{n}{\varphi(n)} \) for \( n \le 1{,}000{,}000 \).

## Key insight
Using the formula
\[
\varphi(n) = n \prod_{p \mid n}\left(1 - \frac{1}{p}\right)
\]
we get
\[
\frac{n}{\varphi(n)} = \prod_{p \mid n} \frac{1}{1 - 1/p} = \prod_{p \mid n} \frac{p}{p-1}.
\]

This ratio depends **only on the distinct prime factors** of \(n\), not on their powers.  
To make the product as large as possible under a constraint \(n \le \text{limit}\), we should include **as many distinct primes as possible**, and they should be the **smallest primes**, because each included prime multiplies the ratio by \( \frac{p}{p-1} > 1 \), and using smaller primes increases the ratio more efficiently per growth of \(n\).

Therefore, the optimal \(n\) is the product of consecutive primes:
\[
n = 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7 \cdot \dots
\]
stopping just before the product would exceed the limit.

## Algorithm
1. Generate primes in increasing order.
2. Multiply them into `n` until `n * p > limit`.
3. Output `n`.

This runs in negligible time for \(10^6\).
