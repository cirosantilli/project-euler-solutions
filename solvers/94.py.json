Add asserts for the test cases given in the problem statement if any, and a print with the final result at the end. Your code must run in a few minutes at most, usually a few seconds. Don't try to brute force the solution, only use brute forcing if needed to better understand the problem on small instances. Don't use external libraries, only the Python standard library. Don't use multithreading, only a single CPU core. Use typing for function signatures.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n\nmain.py\n\n<Python implementation>\n\nREADME.md\n\n<Markdown summary of the reasoning/insights used (high level; no chain-of-thought)>\n\nPROBLEM\n\n# Almost Equilateral Triangles\n\nIt is easily proved that no equilateral triangle exists with integral length sides and integral area. However, the almost equilateral triangle $5$-$5$-$6$ has an area of $12$ square units.\n\nWe shall define an almost equilateral triangle to be a triangle for which two sides are equal and the third differs by no more than one unit.\n\nFind the sum of the perimeters of all almost equilateral triangles with integral side lengths and area and whose perimeters do not exceed one billion ($1\\,000\\,000\\,000$).\n",
