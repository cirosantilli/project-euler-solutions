Add asserts for the test cases given in the problem statement if any, and a print with the final result at the end. Your code must run in a few minutes at most, usually a few seconds. Don't try to brute force the solution, only use brute forcing if needed to better understand the problem on small instances. Don't use external libraries, only the Python standard library. Don't use multithreading, only a single CPU core. Use typing for function signatures.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n\nmain.py\n\n<Python implementation>\n\nREADME.md\n\n<Markdown summary of the reasoning/insights used (high level; no chain-of-thought)>\n\nPROBLEM\n\n# Square Root Convergents\n\nIt is possible to show that the square root of two can be expressed as an infinite continued fraction.\n\n$\\sqrt 2 =1+ \\frac 1 {2+ \\frac 1 {2 +\\frac 1 {2+ \\dots}}}$\n\nBy expanding this for the first four iterations, we get:\n\n$1 + \\frac 1 2 = \\frac 32 = 1.5$  \n$1 + \\frac 1 {2 + \\frac 1 2} = \\frac 7 5 = 1.4$  \n$1 + \\frac 1 {2 + \\frac 1 {2+\\frac 1 2}} = \\frac {17}{12} = 1.41666 \\dots$  \n$1 + \\frac 1 {2 + \\frac 1 {2+\\frac 1 {2+\\frac 1 2}}} = \\frac {41}{29} = 1.41379 \\dots$\n\nThe next three expansions are $\\frac {99}{70}$, $\\frac {239}{169}$, and $\\frac {577}{408}$, but the eighth expansion, $\\frac {1393}{985}$, is the first example where the number of digits in the numerator exceeds the number of digits in the denominator.\n\nIn the first one-thousand expansions, how many fractions contain a numerator with more digits than the denominator?\n",
