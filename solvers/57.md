# Square Root Convergents (√2)

√2 has the continued fraction expansion:

\[
\sqrt{2} = [1; 2, 2, 2, \dots]
\]

The problem asks: among the first 1000 convergents (“expansions” as shown), how many fractions have a numerator with more digits than the denominator?

## Key Insight

If a convergent is \( \frac{p}{q} \), then for √2 with repeating partial quotients 2, the next convergent can be obtained by a simple recurrence:

- \( p' = p + 2q \)
- \( q' = p + q \)

Starting from the first expansion \( \frac{3}{2} \), we iterate this recurrence 1000 times and count when `len(str(p)) > len(str(q))`.

## Complexity

- 1000 iterations with big integers of a few hundred digits.
- Time and memory are easily within limits in PyPy3.

The final count for the first 1000 expansions is **153**.
