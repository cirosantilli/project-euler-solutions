We want the reduced proper fraction `n/d` with `d ≤ 1,000,000` that is **immediately to the left** of `3/7`, i.e. the largest fraction `< 3/7`.

## Key idea
For each denominator `d`, the best numerator `n` that stays strictly below `3/7` is:
- `n = floor((3*d - 1)/7)`

This guarantees `n/d < 3/7` and is the closest such fraction for that fixed `d`.

We then:
1. Check the fraction is reduced (`gcd(n, d) = 1`).
2. Keep the maximum `n/d` using cross-multiplication (`n1/d1 > n2/d2` iff `n1*d2 > n2*d1`).

## Complexity
We scan `d = 1..1,000,000`. Each step uses a `gcd`, so runtime is about `O(N log N)` and runs quickly in PyPy.

The resulting numerator is `428570`.
