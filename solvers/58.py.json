Add asserts for the test cases given in the problem statement if any, and a print with the final result at the end. Your code must run in a few minutes at most, usually a few seconds. Don't try to brute force the solution, only use brute forcing if needed to better understand the problem on small instances. Don't use external libraries, only the Python standard library. Don't use multithreading, only a single CPU core. Use typing for function signatures.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n\nmain.py\n\n<Python implementation>\n\nREADME.md\n\n<Markdown summary of the reasoning/insights used (high level; no chain-of-thought)>\n\nPROBLEM\n\n# Spiral Primes\n\nStarting with $1$ and spiralling anticlockwise in the following way, a square spiral with side length $7$ is formed.\n\n**37** 36 35 34 33 32 **31**  \n38 **17** 16 15 14 **13** 30  \n39 18 \u00a0**5** \u00a04 \u00a0**3** 12 29  \n40 19 \u00a06 \u00a01 \u00a02 11 28  \n41 20 \u00a0**7** \u00a08 \u00a09 10 27  \n42 21 22 23 24 25 26  \n**43** 44 45 46 47 48 49\n\nIt is interesting to note that the odd squares lie along the bottom right diagonal, but what is more interesting is that $8$ out of the $13$ numbers lying along both diagonals are prime; that is, a ratio of $8/13 \\approx 62\\%$.\n\nIf one complete new layer is wrapped around the spiral above, a square spiral with side length $9$ will be formed. If this process is continued, what is the side length of the square spiral for which the ratio of primes along both diagonals first falls below $10\\%$?\n",
