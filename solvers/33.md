# Project Euler 33 Solution - Digit Cancelling Fractions

* [33.py](33.py)

We search all two-digit fractions `n/d` with `10 ≤ n < d < 100` and look for the “curious” property where cancelling a common digit (incorrectly) produces an equivalent reduced fraction.

Key points:
- Exclude trivial cases like `30/50` by skipping fractions where both numbers end in `0`.
- Only attempt cancelling common digits `1..9` (ignore `0` cancels).
- For each common digit `c`, remove one occurrence from numerator and denominator to get single-digit `n2/d2`.
- Check exact equality using cross-multiplication: `n * d2 == d * n2`.
- Multiply the four found fractions and reduce the product by `gcd`; output the reduced denominator.

This finds exactly: `16/64, 19/95, 26/65, 49/98`, whose product in lowest terms has denominator `100`.
