Add asserts for the test cases given in the problem statement if any, and a print with the final result at the end. Your code must run in a few minutes at most, usually a few seconds. Don't try to brute force the solution, only use brute forcing if needed to better understand the problem on small instances. Don't use external libraries, only the Python standard library. Don't use multithreading, only a single CPU core. Don't take input from stdin nor CLI arguments. If an external file is required sa input for the program, use the basename of the problem statement for it. Use typing for function signatures.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n\nmain.py\n\n<Python implementation>\n\nREADME.md\n\n<Markdown summary of the reasoning/insights used (high level; no chain-of-thought)>\n\nPROBLEM\n\n# Special Subset Sums: Testing\n\nLet $S(A)$ represent the sum of elements in set $A$ of size $n$. We shall call it a special sum set if for any two non-empty disjoint subsets, $B$ and $C$, the following properties are true:\n\n1. $S(B) \\ne S(C)$; that is, sums of subsets cannot be equal.\n2. If $B$ contains more elements than $C$ then $S(B) \\gt S(C)$.\n\nFor example, $\\{81, 88, 75, 42, 87, 84, 86, 65\\}$ is not a special sum set because $65 + 87 + 88 = 75 + 81 + 84$, whereas $\\{157, 150, 164, 119, 79, 159, 161, 139, 158\\}$ satisfies both rules for all possible subset pair combinations and $S(A) = 1286$.\n\nUsing [sets.txt](../documents/0105_sets.txt) (right click and \"Save Link/Target As...\"), a 4K text file with one-hundred sets containing seven to twelve elements (the two examples given above are the first two sets in the file), identify all the special sum sets, $A\\_1, A\\_2, \\dots, A\\_k$, and find the value of $S(A\\_1) + S(A\\_2) + \\cdots + S(A\\_k)$.\n\nNOTE: This problem is related to [Problem 103](problem=103) and [Problem 106](problem=106).\n",
