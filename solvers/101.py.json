Add asserts for the test cases given in the problem statement if any, and a print with the final result at the end. Your code must run in a few minutes at most, usually a few seconds. Don't try to brute force the solution, only use brute forcing if needed to better understand the problem on small instances. Don't use external libraries, only the Python standard library. Don't use multithreading, only a single CPU core. Don't take input from stdin nor CLI arguments. If an external file is required sa input for the program, use the basename of the problem statement for it. Use typing for function signatures.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n\nmain.py\n\n<Python implementation>\n\nREADME.md\n\n<Markdown summary of the reasoning/insights used (high level; no chain-of-thought)>\n\nPROBLEM\n\n# Optimum Polynomial\n\nIf we are presented with the first $k$ terms of a sequence it is impossible to say with certainty the value of the next term, as there are infinitely many polynomial functions that can model the sequence.\n\nAs an example, let us consider the sequence of cube numbers. This is defined by the generating function,  \n$u\\_n = n^3$: $1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, \\dots$\n\nSuppose we were only given the first two terms of this sequence. Working on the principle that \"simple is best\" we should assume a linear relationship and predict the next term to be $15$ (common difference $7$). Even if we were presented with the first three terms, by the same principle of simplicity, a quadratic relationship should be assumed.\n\nWe shall define $\\operatorname{OP}(k, n)$ to be the $n$th term of the optimum polynomial generating function for the first $k$ terms of a sequence. It should be clear that $\\operatorname{OP}(k, n)$ will accurately generate the terms of the sequence for $n \\le k$, and potentially the first incorrect term (FIT) will be $\\operatorname{OP}(k, k+1)$; in which case we shall call it a bad OP (BOP).\n\nAs a basis, if we were only given the first term of sequence, it would be most sensible to assume constancy; that is, for $n \\ge 2$, $\\operatorname{OP}(1, n) = u\\_1$.\n\nHence we obtain the following $\\operatorname{OP}$s for the cubic sequence:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| $\\operatorname{OP}(1, n) = 1$ | $1, {\\color{red}\\mathbf 1}, 1, 1, \\dots$ |\n| $\\operatorname{OP}(2, n) = 7n - 6$ | $1, 8, {\\color{red}\\mathbf{15}}, \\dots$ |\n| $\\operatorname{OP}(3, n) = 6n^2 - 11n + 6$ | $1, 8, 27, {\\color{red}\\mathbf{58}}, \\dots$ |\n| $\\operatorname{OP}(4, n) = n^3$ | $1, 8, 27, 64, 125, \\dots$ |\n\nClearly no BOPs exist for $k \\ge 4$.\n\nBy considering the sum of FITs generated by the BOPs (indicated in **red** above), we obtain $1 + 15 + 58 = 74$.\n\nConsider the following tenth degree polynomial generating function:\n$$u\\_n = 1 - n + n^2 - n^3 + n^4 - n^5 + n^6 - n^7 + n^8 - n^9 + n^{10}.$$\n\nFind the sum of FITs for the BOPs.\n",
