## Idea
We need the unique other 4-digit increasing arithmetic sequence of three primes where all three terms are permutations of each other (besides `1487, 4817, 8147`), then output the 12-digit number formed by concatenation.

## Approach
1. **Generate all 4-digit primes** using a sieve up to 9999.
2. **Group primes by digit signature**: sort the digits of each prime (e.g., `2969 -> "2699"`). Primes with the same signature are permutations of each other.
3. For each group with at least 3 primes:
   - Sort the group.
   - Check all pairs `(a, b)` and compute `d = b - a`.
   - If `c = b + d` is also in the group, then `(a, b, c)` is an arithmetic sequence within the permutation group.
4. Ignore the known example sequence and return the other one.
5. Concatenate the three terms into a 12-digit number.

## Complexity
- Sieve: `O(n log log n)` for `n = 9999`.
- Group scanning is small (only 4-digit primes) and easily runs in milliseconds.

## Output
The program prints the required 12-digit concatenation.
