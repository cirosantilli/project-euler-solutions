# Project Euler 105 Solution - Special Subset Sums: Testing

<https://projecteuler.net/problem=105>:

* [105.py](105.py)

We must identify which given sets are **special sum sets**, meaning that for any two non-empty **disjoint** subsets `B` and `C`:

1. `sum(B) != sum(C)`
2. If `|B| > |C|` then `sum(B) > sum(C)`

### Key ideas

#### Fast check for rule (2)
For positive integers, rule (2) is equivalent to checking only the “worst-case” comparisons:
for each `k = 1..n-1`,

- sum of the **smallest** `k+1` elements must be greater than
- sum of the **largest** `k` elements

If this fails for any `k`, the set cannot be special.

#### Checking rule (1) by subset enumeration (n ≤ 12)
Each set has at most 12 elements, so enumerating all non-empty subsets is feasible (`2^12 - 1 = 4095`).

- Represent each subset by a bitmask.
- Compute its sum.
- Store masks per sum.
- If another subset has the same sum, check whether the two masks are disjoint (`mask1 & mask2 == 0`).
  - If disjoint, rule (1) is violated.

### Complexity
For each set: `O(n * 2^n)` with `n ≤ 12`, easily fast for 100 sets.

### Output
The program reads `0105_sets.txt` (or `sets.txt` as a fallback), sums the totals of all special sets, and prints the final answer.
