Add asserts for the test cases given in the problem statement if any, and a print with the final result at the end. Your code must run in a few minutes at most, usually a few seconds. Don't try to brute force the solution, only use brute forcing if needed to better understand the problem on small instances. Don't use external libraries, only the Python standard library. Don't use multithreading, only a single CPU core. Use typing for function signatures.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n\nmain.py\n\n<Python implementation>\n\nREADME.md\n\n<Markdown summary of the reasoning/insights used (high level; no chain-of-thought)>\n\nPROBLEM\n\n# Consecutive Prime Sum\n\nThe prime $41$, can be written as the sum of six consecutive primes:\n\n$$41 = 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13.$$\n\nThis is the longest sum of consecutive primes that adds to a prime below one-hundred.\n\nThe longest sum of consecutive primes below one-thousand that adds to a prime, contains $21$ terms, and is equal to $953$.\n\nWhich prime, below one-million, can be written as the sum of the most consecutive primes?\n",
