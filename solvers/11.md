# Largest Product in a Grid (20×20)

## Approach
- Parse the 20×20 grid into a 2D list of integers.
- For each cell, compute the product of `k=4` adjacent numbers in each of the only necessary directions:
  - right `(0, 1)`
  - down `(1, 0)`
  - down-right diagonal `(1, 1)`
  - down-left diagonal `(1, -1)`
- For each direction, only evaluate if the 4-step segment stays within bounds.
- Track the maximum product encountered.

## Complexity
- The grid is fixed size (20×20), and we check 4 directions per cell.
- Time: `O(20 * 20 * 4 * 4)` operations (tiny).
- Memory: `O(20 * 20)` for storing the grid.

## Notes
- Includes an assert for the example product shown in the problem statement.
- Includes an assert for the known final maximum for this specific grid.
