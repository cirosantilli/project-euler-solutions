Add asserts for the test cases given in the problem statement if any, and a print with the final result at the end. Your code must run in a few minutes at most, usually a few seconds. Don't try to brute force the solution, only use brute forcing if needed to better understand the problem on small instances. Don't use external libraries, only the Python standard library. Don't use multithreading, only a single CPU core. Use typing for function signatures.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n\nmain.py\n\n<Python implementation>\n\nREADME.md\n\n<Markdown summary of the reasoning/insights used (high level; no chain-of-thought)>\n\nPROBLEM\n\n# Powerful Digit Sum\n\nA googol ($10^{100}$) is a massive number: one followed by one-hundred zeros; $100^{100}$ is almost unimaginably large: one followed by two-hundred zeros. Despite their size, the sum of the digits in each number is only $1$.\n\nConsidering natural numbers of the form, $a^b$, where $a, b \\lt 100$, what is the maximum digital sum?\n",
