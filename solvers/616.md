## Key Insight

The game operations allow combining numbers via exponentiation and splitting perfect powers back into base/exponent pairs.

After analysis, the set of **creative integers ≤ 10¹²** turns out to be:

> **All perfect powers ≤ 10¹²**, except:
>
> 1. Numbers of the form **p^q** where **p is prime** and **q is prime**
> 2. The special exception **16**

Therefore:

\[
\text{Answer}
=
\sum(\text{perfect powers} \le 10^{12})
-
\sum(p^q \le 10^{12},\ p,q\ \text{prime})
-
16
\]

## Techniques Used

### 1. Enumerating Perfect Powers
A number is a perfect power if it can be written as `a^b` with `a ≥ 2` and `b ≥ 2`.

We generate all such values for exponents `b = 2..40`:
- `40` is enough because `2^40 > 10^12`
- Each generated value is inserted into a `set` to avoid duplicates like:
  - `64 = 2^6 = 4^3 = 8^2`

### 2. Enumerating Prime^Prime Values
We generate all numbers `p^q ≤ 10^12` where:
- `p` is prime
- `q` is prime

Exponents only need primes up to `37` because:
- `2^37 ≈ 1.37e11`
- `2^41 > 1e12`

Bases are primes up to `10^6`.
