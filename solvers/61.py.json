Add asserts for the test cases given in the problem statement if any, and a print with the final result at the end. Your code must run in a few minutes at most, usually a few seconds. Don't try to brute force the solution, only use brute forcing if needed to better understand the problem on small instances. Don't use external libraries, only the Python standard library. Don't use multithreading, only a single CPU core. Use typing for function signatures.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n\nmain.py\n\n<Python implementation>\n\nREADME.md\n\n<Markdown summary of the reasoning/insights used (high level; no chain-of-thought)>\n\nPROBLEM\n\n# Cyclical Figurate Numbers\n\nTriangle, square, pentagonal, hexagonal, heptagonal, and octagonal numbers are all figurate (polygonal) numbers and are generated by the following formulae:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Triangle |  | $P\\_{3,n}=n(n+1)/2$ |  | $1, 3, 6, 10, 15, \\dots$ |\n| Square |  | $P\\_{4,n}=n^2$ |  | $1, 4, 9, 16, 25, \\dots$ |\n| Pentagonal |  | $P\\_{5,n}=n(3n-1)/2$ |  | $1, 5, 12, 22, 35, \\dots$ |\n| Hexagonal |  | $P\\_{6,n}=n(2n-1)$ |  | $1, 6, 15, 28, 45, \\dots$ |\n| Heptagonal |  | $P\\_{7,n}=n(5n-3)/2$ |  | $1, 7, 18, 34, 55, \\dots$ |\n| Octagonal |  | $P\\_{8,n}=n(3n-2)$ |  | $1, 8, 21, 40, 65, \\dots$ |\n\nThe ordered set of three $4$-digit numbers: $8128$, $2882$, $8281$, has three interesting properties.\n\n1. The set is cyclic, in that the last two digits of each number is the first two digits of the next number (including the last number with the first).\n2. Each polygonal type: triangle ($P\\_{3,127}=8128$), square ($P\\_{4,91}=8281$), and pentagonal ($P\\_{5,44}=2882$), is represented by a different number in the set.\n3. This is the only set of $4$-digit numbers with this property.\n\nFind the sum of the only ordered set of six cyclic $4$-digit numbers for which each polygonal type: triangle, square, pentagonal, hexagonal, heptagonal, and octagonal, is represented by a different number in the set.\n",
