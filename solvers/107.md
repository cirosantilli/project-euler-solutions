# Project Euler 107 Solution - Minimal Network

* [107.py](107.py)

We are given an undirected weighted graph in adjacency-matrix form (with `-` meaning “no edge”).
We want the **maximum saving** obtained by removing redundant edges while keeping the graph connected.

Key observation:
- Keeping the graph connected with minimum total edge weight is exactly the **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)** problem.
- If `W_total` is the sum of all existing edges (count each undirected edge once) and `W_mst` is the MST weight, then:
  - **maximum saving** = `W_total - W_mst`.

Algorithm:
1. Parse the matrix and collect all edges `(weight, u, v)` for `u < v`.
2. Compute `W_total` as the sum of these edges’ weights.
3. Compute `W_mst` using **Kruskal’s algorithm** with a Disjoint Set Union (Union-Find).
4. Output `W_total - W_mst`.

The provided example (7 vertices) is asserted in code:
- total = 243, MST = 93, saving = 150.

The final program reads `0107_network.txt` (or falls back to `network.txt`) and prints the saving.
