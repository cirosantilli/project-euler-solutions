# Project Euler 54 Solution - Poker Hands

* [54.py](54.py)

Each poker hand is mapped to a **comparable rank tuple** so that normal lexicographic comparison determines the winner.

## Key idea: normalize each hand into a rank tuple
For 5 cards we compute:
- `values` (2..14) and `suits`
- `is_flush` (all suits equal)
- `is_straight` (5 distinct values and consecutive), including the special case **A-2-3-4-5** treated as straight-high = 5
- a frequency table of card values (pairs, trips, quads)

We then return a tuple of the form:

`(category, tiebreakers...)`

Where `category` increases with hand strength:
0 High card  
1 One pair  
2 Two pairs  
3 Three of a kind  
4 Straight  
5 Flush  
6 Full house  
7 Four of a kind  
8 Straight flush (covers royal flush as the highest straight flush)

Tiebreakers are added in the exact order used by poker rules, e.g.:
- Pair: `(1, pair_value, remaining_kickers_desc)`
- Two pairs: `(2, high_pair, low_pair, kicker)`
- Full house: `(6, trip_value, pair_value)`
- Flush/high card: `(category, values_desc)`

## Algorithm
For each input line:
1. Split into 10 cards (first 5 for Player 1, last 5 for Player 2)
2. Compute both rank tuples
3. Count cases where Player 1's tuple is greater

This runs in O(N) with tiny constant factors (N=1000), easily within limits.

The provided code includes `assert`s for the five example hands.
