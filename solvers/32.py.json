Add asserts for the test cases given in the problem statement if any, and a print with the final result at the end. Your code must run in a few minutes at most, usually a few seconds. Don't try to brute force the solution, only use brute forcing if needed to better understand the problem on small instances. Don't use external libraries, only the Python standard library. Don't use multithreading, only a single CPU core. Use typing for function signatures.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n\nmain.py\n\n<Python implementation>\n\nREADME.md\n\n<Markdown summary of the reasoning/insights used (high level; no chain-of-thought)>\n\nPROBLEM\n\n# Pandigital Products\n\nWe shall say that an $n$-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of all the digits $1$ to $n$ exactly once; for example, the $5$-digit number, $15234$, is $1$ through $5$ pandigital.\n\nThe product $7254$ is unusual, as the identity, $39 \\times 186 = 7254$, containing multiplicand, multiplier, and product is $1$ through $9$ pandigital.\n\nFind the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product identity can be written as a $1$ through $9$ pandigital.\n\nHINT: Some products can be obtained in more than one way so be sure to only include it once in your sum.\n",
