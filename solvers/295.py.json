Add asserts for the test cases given in the problem statement if any, and a print with the final result at the end. Your code must run in a few minutes at most, usually a few seconds. Don't try to brute force the solution, only use brute forcing if needed to better understand the problem on small instances. Don't use external libraries, only the Python standard library. Don't use multithreading, only a single CPU core. Use typing for function signatures. Also produce a markdown file README.md summarizing the main ideas used. Any known final answer must not appear anywhere in the generated files, don't assert that value, only print it.\n\nPROBLEM\n\n# Lenticular Holes\n\nWe call the convex area enclosed by two circles a lenticular hole if:\n\n* The centres of both circles are on lattice points.\n* The two circles intersect at two distinct lattice points.\n* The interior of the convex area enclosed by both circles does not contain any lattice points.\n\nConsider the circles:  \n$C\\_0$: $x^2 + y^2 = 25$  \n$C\\_1$: $(x + 4)^2 + (y - 4)^2 = 1$  \n$C\\_2$: $(x - 12)^2 + (y - 4)^2 = 65$\n\nThe circles $C\\_0$, $C\\_1$ and $C\\_2$ are drawn in the picture below.\n\n![0295_lenticular.gif](resources/images/0295_lenticular.gif?1678992056)\n\n$C\\_0$ and $C\\_1$ form a lenticular hole, as well as $C\\_0$ and $C\\_2$.\n\nWe call an ordered pair of positive real numbers $(r\\_1, r\\_2)$ a lenticular pair if there exist two circles with radii $r\\_1$ and $r\\_2$ that form a lenticular hole.\nWe can verify that $(1, 5)$ and $(5, \\sqrt{65})$ are the lenticular pairs of the example above.\n\nLet $L(N)$ be the number of **distinct** lenticular pairs $(r\\_1, r\\_2)$ for which $0 \\lt r\\_1 \\le r\\_2 \\le N$.  \nWe can verify that $L(10) = 30$ and $L(100) = 3442$.\n\nFind $L(100\\,000)$.",
