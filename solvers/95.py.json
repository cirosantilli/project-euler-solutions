Add asserts for the test cases given in the problem statement if any, and a print with the final result at the end. Your code must run in a few minutes at most, usually a few seconds. Don't try to brute force the solution, only use brute forcing if needed to better understand the problem on small instances. Don't use external libraries, only the Python standard library. Don't use multithreading, only a single CPU core. Use typing for function signatures.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n\nmain.py\n\n<Python implementation>\n\nREADME.md\n\n<Markdown summary of the reasoning/insights used (high level; no chain-of-thought)>\n\nPROBLEM\n\n# Amicable Chains\n\nThe proper divisors of a number are all the divisors excluding the number itself. For example, the proper divisors of $28$ are $1$, $2$, $4$, $7$, and $14$. As the sum of these divisors is equal to $28$, we call it a perfect number.\n\nInterestingly the sum of the proper divisors of $220$ is $284$ and the sum of the proper divisors of $284$ is $220$, forming a chain of two numbers. For this reason, $220$ and $284$ are called an amicable pair.\n\nPerhaps less well known are longer chains. For example, starting with $12496$, we form a chain of five numbers:\n$$12496 \\to 14288 \\to 15472 \\to 14536 \\to 14264 (\\to 12496 \\to \\cdots)$$\n\nSince this chain returns to its starting point, it is called an amicable chain.\n\nFind the smallest member of the longest amicable chain with no element exceeding one million.\n",
