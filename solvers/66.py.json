Add asserts for the test cases given in the problem statement if any, and a print with the final result at the end. Your code must run in a few minutes at most, usually a few seconds. Don't try to brute force the solution, only use brute forcing if needed to better understand the problem on small instances. Don't use external libraries, only the Python standard library. Don't use multithreading, only a single CPU core. Use typing for function signatures.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n\nmain.py\n\n<Python implementation>\n\nREADME.md\n\n<Markdown summary of the reasoning/insights used (high level; no chain-of-thought)>\n\nPROBLEM\n\n# Diophantine Equation\n\nConsider quadratic Diophantine equations of the form:\n$$x^2 - Dy^2 = 1$$\n\nFor example, when $D=13$, the minimal solution in $x$ is $649^2 - 13 \\times 180^2 = 1$.\n\nIt can be assumed that there are no solutions in positive integers when $D$ is square.\n\nBy finding minimal solutions in $x$ for $D = \\{2, 3, 5, 6, 7\\}$, we obtain the following:\n\n$$\\begin{align}\n3^2 - 2 \\times 2^2 &= 1\\\\\n2^2 - 3 \\times 1^2 &= 1\\\\\n{\\color{red}{\\mathbf 9}}^2 - 5 \\times 4^2 &= 1\\\\\n5^2 - 6 \\times 2^2 &= 1\\\\\n8^2 - 7 \\times 3^2 &= 1\n\\end{align}$$\n\nHence, by considering minimal solutions in $x$ for $D \\le 7$, the largest $x$ is obtained when $D=5$.\n\nFind the value of $D \\le 1000$ in minimal solutions of $x$ for which the largest value of $x$ is obtained.\n",
