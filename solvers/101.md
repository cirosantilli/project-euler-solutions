# Project Euler 101 Solution - Optimum Polynomial

* [101.py](101.py)

We are given a sequence `u_n` generated by a known polynomial. For each `k`, we form the “optimum polynomial” `OP(k, n)`: the unique polynomial of degree `k-1` that matches the first `k` terms `(1, u_1), (2, u_2), ..., (k, u_k)`.  
The first potentially incorrect term (FIT) is `OP(k, k+1)`. We sum these FITs for all “bad OPs”.

## Key idea
For each `k = 1..10`, compute `OP(k, k+1)` via **Lagrange interpolation**, which evaluates the interpolating polynomial at a single point without explicitly expanding coefficients:

\[
P(x) = \sum_{i=1}^{k} u_i \prod_{j \ne i}\frac{x-x_j}{x_i-x_j}
\]

Here `x_i = i`. Since all inputs are small (`k ≤ 10`), exact rational arithmetic (`fractions.Fraction`) is fast and safe; the final result is always an integer.

## What the program does
1. Defines the target sequence:
   \[
   u_n = 1 - n + n^2 - n^3 + \dots + n^{10} = \sum_{i=0}^{10}(-1)^i n^i
   \]
2. For each `k = 1..10`, interpolates using the first `k` terms and evaluates at `n = k+1`.
3. If this value differs from the true `u_{k+1}`, it is a FIT and is added to the total.
4. Includes an assert reproducing the example cubic FIT sum `74`.

The printed output is the required sum of FITs.
