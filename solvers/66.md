We need, for each non-square \(D \le 1000\), the minimal positive integer solution \((x,y)\) to:

\[
x^2 - Dy^2 = 1
\]

This is the classical Pell equation. The minimal solution in \(x\) can be found via the continued fraction expansion of \(\sqrt{D}\):

- Compute the periodic continued fraction of \(\sqrt{D}\) using the standard recurrence with \((m,d,a)\).
- Generate convergents \(h/k\) (numerator/denominator) iteratively.
- The first convergent satisfying \(h^2 - Dk^2 = 1\) gives the minimal \(x = h\).

Algorithm:
1. For each \(D = 2..1000\):
   - Skip perfect squares (no positive integer solutions).
   - Iterate convergents of \(\sqrt{D}\) until \(x^2 - Dy^2 = 1\).
   - Track the \(D\) that yields the largest minimal \(x\).
2. Output that \(D\).

This runs quickly for \(D \le 1000\) and uses only integer arithmetic (Python big integers handle large \(x\) values safely).

Included assertions:
- \(D=13\) has minimal \(x=649\) (given example).
