Add asserts for the test cases given in the problem statement if any, and a print with the final result at the end. Your code must run in a few minutes at most, usually a few seconds. Don't try to brute force the solution, only use brute forcing if needed to better understand the problem on small instances. Don't use external libraries, only the Python standard library. Don't use multithreading, only a single CPU core. Use typing for function signatures.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n\nmain.py\n\n<Python implementation>\n\nREADME.md\n\n<Markdown summary of the reasoning/insights used (high level; no chain-of-thought)>\n\nPROBLEM\n\n# Arithmetic Expressions\n\nBy using each of the digits from the set, $\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$, exactly once, and making use of the four arithmetic operations ($+, -, \\times, /$) and brackets/parentheses, it is possible to form different positive integer targets.\n\nFor example,\n\n$$\\begin{align}\n8 &= (4 \\times (1 + 3)) / 2\\\\\n14 &= 4 \\times (3 + 1 / 2)\\\\\n19 &= 4 \\times (2 + 3) - 1\\\\\n36 &= 3 \\times 4 \\times (2 + 1)\n\\end{align}$$\n\nNote that concatenations of the digits, like $12 + 34$, are not allowed.\n\nUsing the set, $\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$, it is possible to obtain thirty-one different target numbers of which $36$ is the maximum, and each of the numbers $1$ to $28$ can be obtained before encountering the first non-expressible number.\n\nFind the set of four distinct digits, $a \\lt b \\lt c \\lt d$, for which the longest set of consecutive positive integers, $1$ to $n$, can be obtained, giving your answer as a string: *abcd*.\n",
