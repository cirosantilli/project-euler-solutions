## Even Fibonacci Numbers (≤ 4,000,000)

We generate Fibonacci terms starting from `1, 2` using the recurrence:
- `F(n+2) = F(n+1) + F(n)`

While generating terms up to the limit (4,000,000), we accumulate only the even-valued terms into a running sum.

This runs in linear time in the number of Fibonacci terms up to the limit (very small: only a few dozen terms), and constant memory.
