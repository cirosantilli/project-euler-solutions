# Project Euler 106 Solution - Special Subset Sums: Meta-testing

* [106.py](106.py)

We need to count how many disjoint subset pairs must be checked for equal sums, given:

- The set is strictly increasing.
- Rule (2) is already guaranteed: if `|B| > |C|` then `S(B) > S(C)`.

### Key observations

1. If `|B| != |C|`, then rule (2) already implies `S(B) != S(C)`.  
   So only pairs with `|B| = |C| = k` can possibly violate rule (1).

2. Even for equal sizes `k`, some pairs are **forced unequal** without checking sums:
   If, after sorting both subsets, every element of one subset is larger than the
   corresponding element of the other subset, then its sum is larger as well.

3. For a fixed chosen set of `2k` elements, count:
   - Total **unordered** partitions into two `k`-subsets is `C(2k,k)/2`.
   - The number of “elementwise comparable” partitions equals the **Catalan number**
     `Cat(k) = C(2k,k)/(k+1)`. (This is the standard Dyck-word / balanced-parentheses count.)

So for each `k`:
```
tests_per_2k_choice = C(2k,k)/2 - Cat(k)
```
and we can choose the involved `2k` elements in `C(n,2k)` ways.

### Final formula

For `n = 12`:
```
Answer = sum_{k=2..6} C(12,2k) * ( C(2k,k)/2 - Cat(k) )
```

The program computes this value and prints the result.
