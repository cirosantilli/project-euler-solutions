We need products `p = a * b` such that concatenating `a`, `b`, and `p` uses each digit `1..9` exactly once (no zeros, no repeats). Products must be counted only once even if they have multiple valid factor pairs.

## Key insight: digit-length constraints
The concatenation has 9 digits total. The product must be 4 digits, and the only feasible factor-length splits are:

- `1-digit × 4-digit = 4-digit`
- `2-digit × 3-digit = 4-digit`

Other splits cannot yield exactly 9 digits total with a 4-digit product.

## Approach
1. Enumerate `(a, b)` over the two valid digit-length cases.
2. Compute `p = a * b` and require `p` to be 4 digits.
3. Use a bitmask for digits `1..9` to quickly detect:
   - any zero digit,
   - repeated digits within a number,
   - overlaps between `a`, `b`, and `p`.
4. If the combined mask equals all digits `1..9`, store `p` in a set to deduplicate.
5. Sum the unique products in the set.

This brute-force over constrained ranges is small (~150k pairs) and runs quickly in PyPy3.
