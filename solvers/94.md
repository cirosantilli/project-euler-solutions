# Project Euler 94 Solution - Almost Equilateral Triangles

* [94.py](94.py)

We seek triangles with integer sides and integer area where the sides are `(a, a, a±1)` and the perimeter is ≤ 1e9.

## Key reduction
For an isosceles triangle with equal sides `a` and base `b`, the area is:
\[
A = \frac{b}{4}\sqrt{4a^2 - b^2}
\]
So we need `4a^2 - b^2` to be a perfect square.

For `b = a+1`:
\[
4a^2 - (a+1)^2 = 3a^2 - 2a - 1 = k^2
\]
For `b = a-1`:
\[
4a^2 - (a-1)^2 = 3a^2 + 2a - 1 = k^2
\]

Both can be rearranged into the same Pell-type equation:
\[
x^2 - 3y^2 = 4
\]
with:
- `x = 3a - 1` for `(a,a,a+1)`
- `x = 3a + 1` for `(a,a,a-1)`
and `y = k`.

## Generating all solutions efficiently
All solutions to `x^2 - 3y^2 = 4` can be generated by repeatedly multiplying by the fundamental unit `(2 + √3)` (which has norm 1). This gives a simple recurrence:
- `x' = 2x + 3y`
- `y' = x + 2y`

Starting from the first non-degenerate solution `(x,y) = (14,8)` yields the sequence of valid triangles. Each iteration produces the next triangle, and perimeters grow exponentially, so only ~14 terms are needed up to 1e9.

## Complexity
`O(number_of_solutions)` which is `O(log limit)`; runs in milliseconds.

The program sums all generated perimeters ≤ 1e9 and prints the result.
