# Self Powers (last 10 digits)

We need the last 10 digits of:

\[
\sum_{i=1}^{1000} i^i
\]

Only the last 10 digits matter, so we compute everything modulo \(10^{10}\).

## Key idea
Use modular exponentiation:

- Compute each term as `pow(i, i, 10**10)` (fast exponentiation modulo).
- Accumulate the sum modulo \(10^{10}\) to keep numbers small.

This runs quickly because it performs only 1000 modular exponentiations.

## Output formatting
The answer may have leading zeros, so the final value is printed as exactly 10 digits using `zfill(10)`.

## Included assertion
The statement provides the check:

\[
1^1 + 2^2 + \dots + 10^{10} = 10405071317
\]

The program asserts this exact value and also checks its last 10 digits (`0405071317`).
