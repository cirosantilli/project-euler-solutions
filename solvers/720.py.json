Add asserts for the test cases given in the problem statement if any, and a print with the final result at the end. Your code must run in a few minutes at most, usually a few seconds. Don't try to brute force the solution, only use brute forcing if needed to better understand the problem on small instances. The python file must be fully self contained. Don't use external libraries, only the Python standard library. The generated program must not use multithreading, only a single CPU core. The generated program read or write to any files, except to read any input files mentioned in the problem itself, and it cannot use the internet. Use typing for function signatures. Also produce a markdown file solvers/720.md summarizing the main ideas used. Any known final answer must not appear anywhere in the generated files, not even comments, don't assert that value, only print it. If you fail to find an algorithm that produces the correct solution, DO NOT TRY TO CHEAT by hardcoding it in the output program or reading it from some solution repository, either don't create the python file, or make it clearly throw an exception. Ensure that \"./test.py 720\" passes with correct answer 688081048. You MUST make that test pass, if that would take too long then you MUST find a more efficient algorithm.\n\nPROBLEM\n\n# Unpredictable Permutations\n\nConsider all permutations of $\\{1, 2, \\ldots N\\}$, listed in lexicographic order.  \nFor example, for $N=4$, the list starts as follows:\n\n$$\\displaylines{\n(1, 2, 3, 4) \\\\\n(1, 2, 4, 3) \\\\\n(1, 3, 2, 4) \\\\\n(1, 3, 4, 2) \\\\\n(1, 4, 2, 3) \\\\\n(1, 4, 3, 2) \\\\\n(2, 1, 3, 4) \\\\\n\\vdots\n}$$\n\nLet us call a permutation $P$ unpredictable if there is no choice of three indices $i \\lt j \\lt k$ such that $P(i)$, $P(j)$ and $P(k)$ constitute an arithmetic progression.  \n For example, $P=(3, 4, 2, 1)$ is *not* unpredictable because $P(1), P(3), P(4)$ is an arithmetic progression.\n\nLet $S(N)$ be the position within the list of the first unpredictable permutation.\n\nFor example, given $N = 4$, the first unpredictable permutation is $(1, 3, 2, 4)$ so $S(4) = 3$.  \nYou are also given that $S(8) = 2295$ and $S(32) \\equiv 641839205 \\pmod{1\\,000\\,000\\,007}$.\n\nFind $S(2^{25})$. Give your answer modulo $1\\,000\\,000\\,007$.",
