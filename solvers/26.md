For `1/d`, the decimal expansion terminates iff `d` has no prime factors other than `2` and `5`.
Those factors only affect the non-repeating prefix, so we can reduce:

- Let `d' = d` with all factors of `2` and `5` removed.
- If `d' = 1`, the recurring cycle length is `0`.

When `gcd(d', 10) = 1`, the length of the recurring cycle equals the **multiplicative order of 10 modulo `d'`**:
the smallest `k > 0` such that:

`10^k ≡ 1 (mod d')`.

We compute this order by iterating:
`r = 10 % d'`, then repeatedly `r = (r * 10) % d'` until `r == 1`, counting steps.

We evaluate all `d < 1000` and select the one with the maximum cycle length. The result is `983`.
