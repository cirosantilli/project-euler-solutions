Add asserts for the test cases given in the problem statement if any, and a print with the final result at the end. Your code must run in a few minutes at most, usually a few seconds. Don't try to brute force the solution, only use brute forcing if needed to better understand the problem on small instances. Don't use external libraries, only the Python standard library. Don't use multithreading, only a single CPU core. Use typing for function signatures.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n\nmain.py\n\n<Python implementation>\n\nREADME.md\n\n<Markdown summary of the reasoning/insights used (high level; no chain-of-thought)>\n\nPROBLEM\n\n# Path Sum: Three Ways\n\nNOTE: This problem is a more challenging version of [Problem 81](problem=81).\n\nThe minimal path sum in the $5$ by $5$ matrix below, by starting in any cell in the left column and finishing in any cell in the right column, and only moving up, down, and right, is indicated in red and bold; the sum is equal to $994$.\n\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n131 & 673 & \\color{red}{234} & \\color{red}{103} & \\color{red}{18}\\\\\n\\color{red}{201} & \\color{red}{96} & \\color{red}{342} & 965 & 150\\\\\n630 & 803 & 746 & 422 & 111\\\\\n537 & 699 & 497 & 121 & 956\\\\\n805 & 732 & 524 & 37 & 331\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nFind the minimal path sum from the left column to the right column in [matrix.txt](resources/documents/0082_matrix.txt) (right click and \"Save Link/Target As...\"), a 31K text file containing an $80$ by $80$ matrix.\n",
