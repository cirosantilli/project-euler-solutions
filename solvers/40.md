Champernowne's constant is formed by concatenating positive integers:
`0.1234567891011121314...`

We need the product:  
`d1 * d10 * d100 * d1000 * d10000 * d100000 * d1000000`  
where `dn` is the `n`-th digit of the fractional part (1-indexed).

## Key idea
Instead of building the string, locate the digit position mathematically by scanning blocks of numbers with the same digit length:

- 1-digit numbers: `1..9` contribute `9 * 1` digits
- 2-digit numbers: `10..99` contribute `90 * 2` digits
- 3-digit numbers: `100..999` contribute `900 * 3` digits
- etc.

For a given `n`:
1. Subtract whole blocks until `n` lies inside a block of `k`-digit numbers.
2. Determine which number in that block: `(n-1)//k`
3. Determine which digit inside that number: `(n-1)%k`
4. Extract the digit by converting that number to a string.

This runs in `O(log n)` time per query and easily handles `n = 1,000,000`.
