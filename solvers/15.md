# Lattice Paths (20×20)

A path from the top-left to the bottom-right of an `n × m` grid consists of:
- exactly `n` moves down
- exactly `m` moves right

So each valid route is a sequence of `n + m` moves where we choose which `n`
positions are the down moves (the rest are right moves). Therefore the number
of routes is the binomial coefficient:

\[
\binom{n+m}{n} = \binom{n+m}{m}
\]

For a `20 × 20` grid this is:

\[
\binom{40}{20}
\]

The implementation computes `C(n, k)` using an integer multiplicative formula
to avoid large factorials and runs instantly.
