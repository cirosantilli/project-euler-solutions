# Project Euler 67 Solution - Maximum Path Sum II

<https://projecteuler.net/problem=67>:

* [67.py](67.py)

We need the maximum total from top to bottom of a triangle, moving each step to one of the two adjacent numbers directly below.

A brute-force search would consider all paths (for 100 rows, `2^99` paths), which is infeasible.

### Key Insight: Dynamic Programming (Bottom-Up)
Compute the best possible sum from each cell to the bottom:

- Start with the last row as the initial `dp`.
- Move upward row by row.
- For each value `triangle[i][j]`, the best continuation is:
  ```
  triangle[i][j] + max(dp[j], dp[j+1])
  ```
  because from position `(i, j)` you can go to `(i+1, j)` or `(i+1, j+1)`.

After processing to the top, `dp[0]` is the maximum total.

### Complexity
- Time: `O(N^2)` for `N` rows (about 5,050 cells for 100 rows)
- Memory: `O(N)` using a single DP array

The program also includes:
- An assertion for the example triangle (`23`)
- An assertion for the known Euler #67 answer (`7273`)
