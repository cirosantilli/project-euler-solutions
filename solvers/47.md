# Project Euler 47 Solution - Distinct Primes Factors

* [47.py](47.py)

We need the first run of 4 consecutive integers where each integer has exactly 4 **distinct** prime factors.

### Key idea
Use a sieve-like method to compute, for every `n` up to some limit `L`, the number of distinct prime factors:

- Initialize an array `cnt[0..L] = 0`
- For each `p` from `2` to `L`:
  - If `cnt[p] == 0`, then `p` is prime
  - For every multiple `m` of `p`, increment `cnt[m]` by 1  
    (because `p` is a distinct prime factor of `m`)

This gives `cnt[n] = ω(n)` (number of distinct prime factors of `n`) for all `n` in one pass.

### Finding the consecutive run
After computing `cnt`, scan from `2` upward and track the length of the current streak where `cnt[n] == 4`.
When the streak reaches length 4, the start is `n - 3`.

### Robustness
If the answer is not found within the current limit, double the limit and repeat (the provided initial limit is already enough for this problem).

The resulting first number is **134043**.
