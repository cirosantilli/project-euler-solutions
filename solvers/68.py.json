Add asserts for the test cases given in the problem statement if any, and a print with the final result at the end. Your code must run in a few minutes at most, usually a few seconds. Don't try to brute force the solution, only use brute forcing if needed to better understand the problem on small instances. Don't use external libraries, only the Python standard library. Don't use multithreading, only a single CPU core. Use typing for function signatures.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n\nmain.py\n\n<Python implementation>\n\nREADME.md\n\n<Markdown summary of the reasoning/insights used (high level; no chain-of-thought)>\n\nPROBLEM\n\n# Magic 5-gon Ring\n\nConsider the following \"magic\" 3-gon ring, filled with the numbers 1 to 6, and each line adding to nine.\n\n![](resources/images/0068_1.png?1678992052)\n\nWorking **clockwise**, and starting from the group of three with the numerically lowest external node (4,3,2 in this example), each solution can be described uniquely. For example, the above solution can be described by the set: 4,3,2; 6,2,1; 5,1,3.\n\nIt is possible to complete the ring with four different totals: 9, 10, 11, and 12. There are eight solutions in total.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Total** | **Solution Set** |\n| 9 | 4,2,3; 5,3,1; 6,1,2 |\n| 9 | 4,3,2; 6,2,1; 5,1,3 |\n| 10 | 2,3,5; 4,5,1; 6,1,3 |\n| 10 | 2,5,3; 6,3,1; 4,1,5 |\n| 11 | 1,4,6; 3,6,2; 5,2,4 |\n| 11 | 1,6,4; 5,4,2; 3,2,6 |\n| 12 | 1,5,6; 2,6,4; 3,4,5 |\n| 12 | 1,6,5; 3,5,4; 2,4,6 |\n\nBy concatenating each group it is possible to form 9-digit strings; the maximum string for a 3-gon ring is 432621513.\n\nUsing the numbers 1 to 10, and depending on arrangements, it is possible to form 16- and 17-digit strings. What is the maximum **16-digit** string for a \"magic\" 5-gon ring?\n\n![](resources/images/0068_2.png?1678992052)\n",
