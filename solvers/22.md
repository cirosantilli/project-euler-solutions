# Project Euler 22 Solution - Names Scores

<https://projecteuler.net/problem=22>:

* [22.py](22.py)

## Idea
1. Read the file of names, which is a single comma-separated line of quoted strings.
2. Sort the names alphabetically.
3. For each name at 1-based position `i`, compute its alphabetical value:
   - `A=1, B=2, ..., Z=26`
   - sum these values over all letters in the name
4. Add `i * value(name)` to the running total.

## Correctness checks
- Verifies the statement example: `COLIN` is the 938th name and has score `49714`.
- Verifies the known final total for the standard dataset: `871198282`.

## Complexity
- Sorting dominates: `O(N log N)` for about 5000 names.
- Scoring is linear in total characters, easily within time limits.
