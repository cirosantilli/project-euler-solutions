Add asserts for the test cases given in the problem statement if any, and a print with the final result at the end. Your code must run in a few minutes at most, usually a few seconds. Don't try to brute force the solution, only use brute forcing if needed to better understand the problem on small instances. Don't use external libraries, only the Python standard library. Don't use multithreading, only a single CPU core. Use typing for function signatures.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n\nmain.py\n\n<Python implementation>\n\nREADME.md\n\n<Markdown summary of the reasoning/insights used (high level; no chain-of-thought)>\n\nPROBLEM\n\n# Prime Permutations\n\nThe arithmetic sequence, $1487, 4817, 8147$, in which each of the terms increases by $3330$, is unusual in two ways: (i) each of the three terms are prime, and, (ii) each of the $4$-digit numbers are permutations of one another.\n\nThere are no arithmetic sequences made up of three $1$-, $2$-, or $3$-digit primes, exhibiting this property, but there is one other $4$-digit increasing sequence.\n\nWhat $12$-digit number do you form by concatenating the three terms in this sequence?\n",
