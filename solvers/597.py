"""
Project Euler 597 - Torpids

We compute p(n, L): the probability that the final ordering is an even permutation.

Key trick:
Let each boat i have speed V_i ~ Exp(1) (because V_i = -log(U_i), U_i uniform).
For a "target" located at coordinate t (in boat-index units), boat i's "relative speed"
to that target is W_i = V_i / (t - i).  Then W_i ~ Exp(rate = t - i).

The slowest boat relative to the current target is the one with minimal W_i.
That boat cannot bump anyone and becomes the lowest boat in the resulting order.
Conditioning on which boat is minimal allows a recursive decomposition of the race.

We only track the *parity* of the final permutation using the expected sign (+1 even, -1 odd).
