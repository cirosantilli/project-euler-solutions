Add asserts for the test cases given in the problem statement if any, and a print with the final result at the end. Your code must run in a few minutes at most, usually a few seconds. Don't try to brute force the solution, only use brute forcing if needed to better understand the problem on small instances. Don't use external libraries, only the Python standard library. Don't use multithreading, only a single CPU core. Use typing for function signatures.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n\nmain.py\n\n<Python implementation>\n\nREADME.md\n\n<Markdown summary of the reasoning/insights used (high level; no chain-of-thought)>\n\nPROBLEM\n\n# Roman Numerals\n\nFor a number written in Roman numerals to be considered valid there are basic rules which must be followed. Even though the rules allow some numbers to be expressed in more than one way there is always a \"best\" way of writing a particular number.\n\nFor example, it would appear that there are at least six ways of writing the number sixteen:\n\nIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII  \nVIIIIIIIIIII  \nVVIIIIII  \nXIIIIII  \nVVVI  \nXVI\n\nHowever, according to the rules only XIIIIII and XVI are valid, and the last example is considered to be the most efficient, as it uses the least number of numerals.\n\nThe 11K text file, [roman.txt](resources/documents/0089_roman.txt) (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), contains one thousand numbers written in valid, but not necessarily minimal, Roman numerals; see [About... Roman Numerals](about=roman_numerals) for the definitive rules for this problem.\n\nFind the number of characters saved by writing each of these in their minimal form.\n\nNote: You can assume that all the Roman numerals in the file contain no more than four consecutive identical units.\n",
