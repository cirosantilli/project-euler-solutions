# Project Euler 29 Solution - Distinct Powers

<https://projecteuler.net/problem=29>:

* [29.py](29.py)

We need the number of distinct values of \(a^b\) for all integers:
- \(2 \le a \le 100\)
- \(2 \le b \le 100\)

### Key idea
Directly generate every value \(a^b\) and insert it into a set:
- A set automatically removes duplicates (e.g., \(4^3 = 8^2 = 64\)).
- There are only \(99 \times 99 = 9801\) pairs, so this is fast.
- Python's arbitrary-precision integers can represent these powers exactly.

### Complexity
- Time: \(O(9801)\) power computations (very small)
- Memory: proportional to the number of distinct results stored in the set

An assertion checks the sample case \(2..5\) which should yield 15 distinct terms.
The program prints the final count for \(2..100\).
