# Project Euler 529 Solution - $10$-substrings

* [529.py](529.py)

## Key ideas

- Work with zero-free strings (digits 1–9) first. Any friendly string stays friendly after inserting zeros because zeros do not change sums. This gives a binomial transform from zero-free counts to all-length counts.
- For zero-free strings, only the **maximal suffix with sum <= 10** can still participate in a future 10-substring. Older digits must already be covered or the string is invalid.
- Track a DFA state as:
  - the digits of that maximal suffix (sum <= 10), and
  - how many trailing digits are still uncovered (these always form a suffix).
- Transitions append a digit, drop covered digits while the sum exceeds 10, and mark all digits covered when the suffix sum reaches 10.
- The zero-free count sequence has a linear recurrence of degree at most the DFA size. Use Berlekamp–Massey to recover the recurrence, then evaluate the binomial transform at `n = 10^18` via polynomial exponentiation in the quotient ring.

## Complexity notes

- The DFA has only a few thousand states, so generating the recurrence terms is fast.
- Polynomial exponentiation and convolution are done with packed big integers to keep it efficient in Python.
