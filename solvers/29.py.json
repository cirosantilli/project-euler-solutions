Add asserts for the test cases given in the problem statement if any, and a print with the final result at the end. Your code must run in a few minutes at most, usually a few seconds. Don't try to brute force the solution, only use brute forcing if needed to better understand the problem on small instances. Don't use external libraries, only the Python standard library. Don't use multithreading, only a single CPU core. Use typing for function signatures.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n\nmain.py\n\n<Python implementation>\n\nREADME.md\n\n<Markdown summary of the reasoning/insights used (high level; no chain-of-thought)>\n\nPROBLEM\n\n# Distinct Powers\n\nConsider all integer combinations of $a^b$ for $2 \\le a \\le 5$ and $2 \\le b \\le 5$:\n$$\\begin{array}{rrrr}\n2^2=4, &2^3=8, &2^4=16, &2^5=32\\\\\n3^2=9, &3^3=27, &3^4=81, &3^5=243\\\\\n4^2=16, &4^3=64, &4^4=256, &4^5=1024\\\\\n5^2=25, &5^3=125, &5^4=625, &5^5=3125\n\\end{array}$$\n\nIf they are then placed in numerical order, with any repeats removed, we get the following sequence of $15$ distinct terms:\n$$4, 8, 9, 16, 25, 27, 32, 64, 81, 125, 243, 256, 625, 1024, 3125.$$\n\nHow many distinct terms are in the sequence generated by $a^b$ for $2 \\le a \\le 100$ and $2 \\le b \\le 100$?\n",
