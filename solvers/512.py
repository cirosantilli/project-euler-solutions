Project Euler Problem 512

It appears that f(n) = 0 when n is even and is equal to phi(n) when n is odd

why?
phi(n^k) = n^k Prod(p|n^k) (1 - 1/p) = n^(k-1) * (n Prod(p/n <=> p/n^k) (1- 1/p)) = n^(k-1) * phi(n)

Now because phi(n^k) = n^(k-1) * phi(n) => 
phi(n^k) = (-1)^(k-1) phi(n) mod(n+1)

so f(n) = sum_{k = 1 to n} phi(n^k) mod(n+1) = sum_{k = 1 to n} (-1)^(k-1) phi(n)
Therefore when n is even we have f(n) = 0
and when n is odd we have f(n) = phi(n)
