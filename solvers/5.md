# Smallest Multiple (1..20)

To find the smallest positive number divisible by every integer from `1` to `20`, compute the **least common multiple (LCM)** of all numbers in that range.

Key ideas:
- The smallest number divisible by both `a` and `b` is `lcm(a, b)`.
- Use the relationship:  
  `lcm(a, b) = a / gcd(a, b) * b`  
  where `gcd` is the greatest common divisor.
- Iteratively fold the LCM across the range:  
  `lcm(1..n) = lcm(lcm(...lcm(1,2),3)..., n)`.

This runs very fast because it only performs 19 `gcd` computations and multiplications for `n=20`.

The program also includes the provided check: `lcm(1..10) = 2520`.
