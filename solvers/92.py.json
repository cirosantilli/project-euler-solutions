Add asserts for the test cases given in the problem statement if any, and a print with the final result at the end. Your code must run in a few minutes at most, usually a few seconds. Don't try to brute force the solution, only use brute forcing if needed to better understand the problem on small instances. Don't use external libraries, only the Python standard library. Don't use multithreading, only a single CPU core. Use typing for function signatures.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n\nmain.py\n\n<Python implementation>\n\nREADME.md\n\n<Markdown summary of the reasoning/insights used (high level; no chain-of-thought)>\n\nPROBLEM\n\n# Square Digit Chains\n\nA number chain is created by continuously adding the square of the digits in a number to form a new number until it has been seen before.\n\nFor example,\n$$\\begin{align}\n&44 \\to 32 \\to 13 \\to 10 \\to \\mathbf 1 \\to \\mathbf 1\\\\\n&85 \\to \\mathbf{89} \\to 145 \\to 42 \\to 20 \\to 4 \\to 16 \\to 37 \\to 58 \\to \\mathbf{89}\n\\end{align}$$\n\nTherefore any chain that arrives at $1$ or $89$ will become stuck in an endless loop. What is most amazing is that EVERY starting number will eventually arrive at $1$ or $89$.\n\nHow many starting numbers below ten million will arrive at $89$?\n",
