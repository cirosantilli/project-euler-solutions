Add asserts for the test cases given in the problem statement if any, and a print with the final result at the end. Your code must run in a few minutes at most, usually a few seconds. Don't try to brute force the solution, only use brute forcing if needed to better understand the problem on small instances. Don't use external libraries, only the Python standard library. Don't use multithreading, only a single CPU core. Use typing for function signatures.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n\nmain.py\n\n<Python implementation>\n\nREADME.md\n\n<Markdown summary of the reasoning/insights used (high level; no chain-of-thought)>\n\nPROBLEM\n\n# Digit Fifth Powers\n\nSurprisingly there are only three numbers that can be written as the sum of fourth powers of their digits:\n$$\\begin{align}\n1634 &= 1^4 + 6^4 + 3^4 + 4^4\\\\\n8208 &= 8^4 + 2^4 + 0^4 + 8^4\\\\\n9474 &= 9^4 + 4^4 + 7^4 + 4^4\n\\end{align}$$\n\nAs $1 = 1^4$ is not a sum it is not included.\n\nThe sum of these numbers is $1634 + 8208 + 9474 = 19316$.\n\nFind the sum of all the numbers that can be written as the sum of fifth powers of their digits.\n",
