Add asserts for the test cases given in the problem statement if any, and a print with the final result at the end. Your code must run in a few minutes at most, usually a few seconds. Don't try to brute force the solution, only use brute forcing if needed to better understand the problem on small instances. Don't use external libraries, only the Python standard library. Don't use multithreading, only a single CPU core. Use typing for function signatures.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n\nmain.py\n\n<Python implementation>\n\nREADME.md\n\n<Markdown summary of the reasoning/insights used (high level; no chain-of-thought)>\n\nPROBLEM\n\n# Pandigital Multiples\n\nTake the number $192$ and multiply it by each of $1$, $2$, and $3$:\n\n$$\\begin{align}\n192 \\times 1 &= 192\\\\\n192 \\times 2 &= 384\\\\\n192 \\times 3 &= 576\n\\end{align}$$\n\nBy concatenating each product we get the $1$ to $9$ pandigital, $192384576$. We will call $192384576$ the concatenated product of $192$ and $(1,2,3)$.\n\nThe same can be achieved by starting with $9$ and multiplying by $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$, and $5$, giving the pandigital, $918273645$, which is the concatenated product of $9$ and $(1,2,3,4,5)$.\n\nWhat is the largest $1$ to $9$ pandigital $9$-digit number that can be formed as the concatenated product of an integer with $(1,2, \\dots, n)$ where $n \\gt 1$?\n",
