Add asserts for the test cases given in the problem statement if any, and a print with the final result at the end. Your code must run in a few minutes at most, usually a few seconds. Don't try to brute force the solution, only use brute forcing if needed to better understand the problem on small instances. Don't use external libraries, only the Python standard library. Don't use multithreading, only a single CPU core. Don't take input from stdin nor CLI arguments. If an external file is required sa input for the program, use the basename of the problem statement for it. Use typing for function signatures.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n\nmain.py\n\n<Python implementation>\n\nREADME.md\n\n<Markdown summary of the reasoning/insights used (high level; no chain-of-thought)>\n\nPROBLEM\n\n# Minimal Network\n\nThe following undirected network consists of seven vertices and twelve edges with a total weight of 243.\n\n![](resources/images/0107_1.png?1678992052)\n\nThe same network can be represented by the matrix below.\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **A** | **B** | **C** | **D** | **E** | **F** | **G** |\n| **A** | - | 16 | 12 | 21 | - | - | - |\n| **B** | 16 | - | - | 17 | 20 | - | - |\n| **C** | 12 | - | - | 28 | - | 31 | - |\n| **D** | 21 | 17 | 28 | - | 18 | 19 | 23 |\n| **E** | - | 20 | - | 18 | - | - | 11 |\n| **F** | - | - | 31 | 19 | - | - | 27 |\n| **G** | - | - | - | 23 | 11 | 27 | - |\n\nHowever, it is possible to optimise the network by removing some edges and still ensure that all points on the network remain connected. The network which achieves the maximum saving is shown below. It has a weight of 93, representing a saving of 243 \u2212 93 = 150 from the original network.\n\n![](resources/images/0107_2.png?1678992052)\n\nUsing [network.txt](../documents/0107_network.txt) (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 6K text file containing a network with forty vertices, and given in matrix form, find the maximum saving which can be achieved by removing redundant edges whilst ensuring that the network remains connected.\n",
