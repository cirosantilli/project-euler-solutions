Add asserts for the test cases given in the problem statement if any, and a print with the final result at the end. Your code must run in a few minutes at most, usually a few seconds. Don't try to brute force the solution, only use brute forcing if needed to better understand the problem on small instances. Don't use external libraries, only the Python standard library. Don't use multithreading, only a single CPU core. Use typing for function signatures.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n\nmain.py\n\n<Python implementation>\n\nREADME.md\n\n<Markdown summary of the reasoning/insights used (high level; no chain-of-thought)>\n\nPROBLEM\n\n# Cuboid Route\n\nA spider, S, sits in one corner of a cuboid room, measuring $6$ by $5$ by $3$, and a fly, F, sits in the opposite corner. By travelling on the surfaces of the room the shortest \"straight line\" distance from S to F is $10$ and the path is shown on the diagram.\n\n![](resources/images/0086.png?1678992052)\n\nHowever, there are up to three \"shortest\" path candidates for any given cuboid and the shortest route doesn't always have integer length.\n\nIt can be shown that there are exactly $2060$ distinct cuboids, ignoring rotations, with integer dimensions, up to a maximum size of $M$ by $M$ by $M$, for which the shortest route has integer length when $M = 100$. This is the least value of $M$ for which the number of solutions first exceeds two thousand; the number of solutions when $M = 99$ is $1975$.\n\nFind the least value of $M$ such that the number of solutions first exceeds one million.\n",
