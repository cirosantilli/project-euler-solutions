* [82.lean](82.lean)

We need the minimal cost path that starts anywhere in the left column and ends anywhere in the right column, moving only **right**, **up**, and **down**.

### Key idea (dynamic programming by columns)
Process the matrix column-by-column while maintaining:

- `dp[i]`: minimal cost to reach row `i` in the current column.

For each new column `j`:

1. **Move right into column `j`**:
   - `temp[i] = dp[i] + mat[i][j]`

2. **Allow vertical moves within column `j`**:
   Once inside the column, we can move up/down any number of times.
   Because all weights are positive, an optimal path in a single column will never change vertical direction more than once (otherwise it contains a removable positive-cost cycle).
   Therefore, two linear relaxations are sufficient:
   - Top-down pass to account for paths that move down.
   - Bottom-up pass to account for paths that move up.

After processing all columns, the answer is `min(dp)` in the last column.

### Complexity
- Time: `O(n^2)` (two passes per column)
- Memory: `O(n)`

Includes an assertion for the given 5×5 example (`994`).
