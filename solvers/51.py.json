Add asserts for the test cases given in the problem statement if any, and a print with the final result at the end. Your code must run in a few minutes at most, usually a few seconds. Don't try to brute force the solution, only use brute forcing if needed to better understand the problem on small instances. Don't use external libraries, only the Python standard library. Don't use multithreading, only a single CPU core. Use typing for function signatures.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n\nmain.py\n\n<Python implementation>\n\nREADME.md\n\n<Markdown summary of the reasoning/insights used (high level; no chain-of-thought)>\n\nPROBLEM\n\n# Prime Digit Replacements\n\nBy replacing the 1st digit of the 2-digit number \\*3, it turns out that six of the nine possible values: 13, 23, 43, 53, 73, and 83, are all prime.\n\nBy replacing the 3rd and 4th digits of 56\\*\\*3 with the same digit, this 5-digit number is the first example having seven primes among the ten generated numbers, yielding the family: 56003, 56113, 56333, 56443, 56663, 56773, and 56993. Consequently 56003, being the first member of this family, is the smallest prime with this property.\n\nFind the smallest prime which, by replacing part of the number (not necessarily adjacent digits) with the same digit, is part of an eight prime value family.\n",
