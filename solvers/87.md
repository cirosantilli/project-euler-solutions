# Project Euler 87 Solution - Prime Power Triples

* [87.py](87.py)

We want to count distinct numbers below `50,000,000` that can be written as:

`p^2 + q^3 + r^4` where `p, q, r` are primes.

## Key observations
- The largest prime needed for squares is `sqrt(limit)`, since `p^2 < limit`.
- Similarly, cubes and fourth powers automatically stay within the limit once we filter by checking `p^3 < limit` and `p^4 < limit`.
- Counts are small enough for a straightforward triple loop after precomputing prime powers:
  - primes up to ~7071 for squares
  - ~73 primes for cubes and ~23 primes for fourth powers
  - total combinations are about 1.5 million, which is fast in PyPy.

## Approach
1. Sieve all primes up to `isqrt(limit)`.
2. Build sorted lists of all prime squares, cubes, and fourth powers below the limit.
3. Iterate over `fourths`, `cubes`, then `squares`, using sorted-order `break` pruning when sums exceed the limit.
4. Insert each valid sum into a `set` to ensure uniqueness.
5. Answer is the size of the set.

A small correctness check from the statement is included:
- There are exactly 4 representable numbers below 50.
