We need the sum of all numbers `< 1,000,000` that are palindromic in both base 10 and base 2 (no leading zeros allowed).

## Key ideas
- Instead of checking every number up to one million, we **generate only decimal palindromes** below the limit.
- Any decimal palindrome below `1,000,000` has at most 6 digits. These can be built by mirroring a "half":
  - **Odd length**: `s + reverse(s[:-1])`
  - **Even length**: `s + reverse(s)`
  where `s = str(i)` and `i` ranges from `1` to `999`.
- A binary palindrome cannot be even (it would end in `0`, and reversing would create a leading zero), so we skip even candidates.
- For each generated decimal palindrome, check if its binary representation `bin(n)[2:]` is also a palindrome.

This approach is fast and simple.
