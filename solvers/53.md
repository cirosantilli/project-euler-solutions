We must count how many binomial coefficients `C(n, r)` with `1 ≤ n ≤ 100` exceed `1,000,000` (counting pairs `(n,r)`, not distinct values).

## Key insights
- Use the recurrence to compute binomial coefficients efficiently without factorials:
  - `C(n, 0) = 1`
  - `C(n, r) = C(n, r-1) * (n-r+1) / r` (always an integer)
- For fixed `n`, the sequence `C(n, r)` increases up to `r = floor(n/2)` and is symmetric:
  - `C(n, r) = C(n, n-r)`
- Therefore, once we find the smallest `r` (with `r ≤ n/2`) such that `C(n, r) > 1,000,000`,
  then **all** `r` in the range `[r, n-r]` exceed the threshold.
  The count contributed by this `n` is `n - 2r + 1`.

## Complexity
For each `n` we scan `r` only up to `n/2` and often stop early, so this runs extremely fast for `n ≤ 100`.

The final answer printed is `4075`.
