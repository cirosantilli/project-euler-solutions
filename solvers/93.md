# Project Euler 93 Solution - Arithmetic Expressions

<https://projecteuler.net/problem=93>:

* [93.py](93.py)

We must choose 4 distinct digits `a<b<c<d` (from 0–9). Using each digit exactly once and the operations `+ - * /` with arbitrary parentheses, we can form many values. For each digit set, we want the longest consecutive run of positive integers starting at 1 (i.e., `1..n` all representable).

## Key idea

Generate **all possible expression results** for a given 4-digit set by exploring all binary expression trees:

- Start with the 4 numbers as exact rational values (`fractions.Fraction`).
- Repeatedly pick any pair `(x, y)` from the current multiset and replace it with each possible operation result:
  - `x+y`, `x-y`, `y-x`, `x*y`, `x/y` (if `y!=0`), `y/x` (if `x!=0`)
- Recurse until only one value remains; collect all such results.

This recursion implicitly covers all digit orders and all parenthesizations.

## Exact arithmetic

To avoid floating-point errors, all computations use `Fraction`, so checking “is a positive integer” is exact (`denominator == 1` and numerator > 0).

## Optimization

A memoization dictionary keyed by the sorted tuple of current `Fraction` values avoids recomputing identical subproblems (same multiset of intermediate values).

## Result selection

For each 4-digit combination:
- compute all reachable values
- keep the set of reachable positive integers
- measure the consecutive run length from 1 upward

The best digit set is printed as a concatenated string `abcd`.

The included asserts verify:
- `{1,2,3,4}` has run length 28 and maximum value 36 (as stated)
- the final answer is `1258` with run length 51
