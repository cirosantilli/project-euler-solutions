# Project Euler 81 Solution - Path Sum: Two Ways

<https://projecteuler.net/problem=81>:

* [81.py](81.py)

We need the minimal path sum from the top-left to the bottom-right of an `N x N` matrix, moving only **right** and **down**.

## Key Insight (Dynamic Programming)
Because movement is restricted to right/down, the best path to any cell `(i, j)` must come from exactly one of:
- the cell above `(i-1, j)`, or
- the cell to the left `(i, j-1)`.

So:
`best(i, j) = matrix[i][j] + min(best(i-1, j), best(i, j-1))`

We compute this efficiently in `O(N^2)` time, keeping only one row of DP values (`O(N)` memory).
