## Summation of Primes (below 2,000,000)

We need the sum of all primes strictly less than a given limit (2,000,000).

### Key idea: Sieve of Eratosthenes (odd-only optimization)
- Use a sieve to mark composite numbers up to `limit - 1`.
- Optimize memory and speed by storing only odd candidates:
  - Index `i` represents the odd number `2*i + 3` (i.e., 3, 5, 7, ...).
  - Prime `2` is handled separately.

### Marking composites
For each found odd prime `p`, start marking from `p*p` (smaller multiples have already been handled) and step by `p` in the odd-only index space.

### Complexity
- Time: about `O(n log log n)` which is fast for 2,000,000.
- Memory: about `n/2` bytes using a `bytearray`.

The program includes the sample assertion `sum_primes_below(10) == 17` and prints the final answer for 2,000,000.
