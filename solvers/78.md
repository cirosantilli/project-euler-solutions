We need the smallest `n` such that the partition number `p(n)` (ways to write `n` as a sum of positive integers, order ignored) is divisible by 1,000,000.

## Key idea: Euler’s pentagonal number theorem
Partition numbers satisfy the recurrence:

\[
p(0)=1,\quad
p(n)=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} (-1)^{k-1}\left(p(n-g_k)+p(n-g'_k)\right)
\]

where

- \( g_k = \frac{k(3k-1)}{2} \)
- \( g'_k = \frac{k(3k+1)}{2} \)

These are the generalized pentagonal numbers. For a fixed `n`, only terms with `g <= n` contribute, so the inner sum is finite.

## Efficient computation mod 1,000,000
We compute `p(n) mod 1_000_000` iteratively from `n=1` upward, using the recurrence above, and stop at the first `n` where the result is `0`.

This runs in about \(O(n\sqrt{n})\), because the number of generalized pentagonal numbers ≤ `n` is ~`sqrt(n)`. For the known solution range (~55k), this is fast in PyPy.

## Output
The program prints the least `n` such that `p(n)` is divisible by one million.
