Add asserts for the test cases given in the problem statement if any, and a print with the final result at the end. Your code must run in a few minutes at most, usually a few seconds. Don't try to brute force the solution, only use brute forcing if needed to better understand the problem on small instances. Don't use external libraries, only the Python standard library. Don't use multithreading, only a single CPU core. Use typing for function signatures.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n\nmain.py\n\n<Python implementation>\n\nREADME.md\n\n<Markdown summary of the reasoning/insights used (high level; no chain-of-thought)>\n\nPROBLEM\n\n# Convergents of $e$\n\nThe square root of $2$ can be written as an infinite continued fraction.\n\n$$\\sqrt{2} = 1 + \\dfrac{1}{2 + \\dfrac{1}{2 + \\dfrac{1}{2 + \\dfrac{1}{2 + ...}}}}$$\n\nThe infinite continued fraction can be written, $\\sqrt{2} = [1; (2)]$, $(2)$ indicates that $2$ repeats *ad infinitum*. In a similar way, $\\sqrt{23} = [4; (1, 3, 1, 8)]$.\n\nIt turns out that the sequence of partial values of continued fractions for square roots provide the best rational approximations. Let us consider the convergents for $\\sqrt{2}$.\n\n$$\\begin{align}\n&1 + \\dfrac{1}{2} &= \\dfrac{3}{2} \\\\\n&1 + \\dfrac{1}{2 + \\dfrac{1}{2}} &= \\dfrac{7}{5}\\\\\n&1 + \\dfrac{1}{2 + \\dfrac{1}{2 + \\dfrac{1}{2}}} &= \\dfrac{17}{12}\\\\\n&1 + \\dfrac{1}{2 + \\dfrac{1}{2 + \\dfrac{1}{2 + \\dfrac{1}{2}}}} &= \\dfrac{41}{29}\n\\end{align}$$\n\nHence the sequence of the first ten convergents for $\\sqrt{2}$ are:\n\n$$1, \\dfrac{3}{2}, \\dfrac{7}{5}, \\dfrac{17}{12}, \\dfrac{41}{29}, \\dfrac{99}{70}, \\dfrac{239}{169}, \\dfrac{577}{408}, \\dfrac{1393}{985}, \\dfrac{3363}{2378}, ...$$\n\nWhat is most surprising is that the important mathematical constant,\n\n$$e = [2; 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 6, 1, ... , 1, 2k, 1, ...]$$\n\nThe first ten terms in the sequence of convergents for $e$ are:\n\n$$2, 3, \\dfrac{8}{3}, \\dfrac{11}{4}, \\dfrac{19}{7}, \\dfrac{87}{32}, \\dfrac{106}{39}, \\dfrac{193}{71}, \\dfrac{1264}{465}, \\dfrac{1457}{536}, ...$$\n\nThe sum of digits in the numerator of the $10$th convergent is $1 + 4 + 5 + 7 = 17$.\n\nFind the sum of digits in the numerator of the $100$th convergent of the continued fraction for $e$.\n",
