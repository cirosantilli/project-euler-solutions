Add asserts for the test cases given in the problem statement if any, and a print with the final result at the end. Your code must run in a few minutes at most, usually a few seconds. Don't try to brute force the solution, only use brute forcing if needed to better understand the problem on small instances. Don't use external libraries, only the Python standard library. Don't use multithreading, only a single CPU core. Use typing for function signatures.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n\nmain.py\n\n<Python implementation>\n\nREADME.md\n\n<Markdown summary of the reasoning/insights used (high level; no chain-of-thought)>\n\nPROBLEM\n\n# Maximum Path Sum II\n\nBy starting at the top of the triangle below and moving to adjacent numbers on the row below, the maximum total from top to bottom is 23.\n\n**3**  \n**7** 4  \n2 **4** 6  \n8 5 **9** 3\n\nThat is, 3 + 7 + 4 + 9 = 23.\n\nFind the maximum total from top to bottom in [triangle.txt](resources/documents/0067_triangle.txt) (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 15K text file containing a triangle with one-hundred rows.\n\n**NOTE:** This is a much more difficult version of [Problem 18](problem=18). It is not possible to try every route to solve this problem, as there are $2^{99}$ altogether! If you could check one trillion ($10^{12}$) routes every second it would take over twenty billion years to check them all. There is an efficient algorithm to solve it. ;o)\n",
