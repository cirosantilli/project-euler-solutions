Project Euler Problem 686

2^7 = 128 is the first power of two whose leading digits are "12".
The next power of two whose leading digits are "12" is .

Define p(L, n) to be the nth-smallest value of j such that the base 10 representation of 2^j begins with the digits 
of L

You are also given that p(123, 45) = 12710

Find p(123, 678910)

Through testing I notice the next number such that 2^j starts with 123 is either 196, 289 or 485 away

we are looking for 
2^k = 123.....
2^k = 1.23... * 10^x
log(10)(2^k) = log(10)(1.23... * 10^x)
k*log(10)(2) = log(10)(1.23...) + x
