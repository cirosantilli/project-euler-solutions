## Key Observations

Two sticks repeatedly travel under the bridge:

- Each travel time is an **integer uniform random** in `[n, m]`.
- After emerging, a stick is retrieved and redeployed upstream in **exactly 5 seconds**.
- The game ends when a stick emerges while the other is still travelling **and**
  the winner has completed **two more journeys** than the loser  
  (because the loser has started the current journey but not yet completed it).

So we stop when the journey count difference reaches `±2`.

## Technique 1 — Event-driven Markov Model (not per-second)

Instead of stepping through every second, we jump between **emergence events**.

A state is determined by:

- the journey difference `D`
- the remaining time until each stick emerges

A naive Markov chain over `(D, a, b)` would be ~`3 * 105² ≈ 33k` states per pair,
too expensive to solve for ~5000 parameter pairs.

## Technique 2 — 2D → 1D Reduction by Averaging Reset Times

After any emergence, the emerging stick’s next emergence time becomes:
