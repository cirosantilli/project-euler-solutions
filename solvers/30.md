We want all integers that equal the sum of the **fifth powers** of their decimal digits, excluding `1` (since it is not considered a “sum” in the problem statement).

## Key insight: finite search bound
For a `k`-digit number, the largest possible sum of fifth powers of its digits occurs when all digits are `9`:
- max sum = `k * 9^5`

But any `k`-digit number is at least `10^(k-1)`.  
If `k * 9^5 < 10^(k-1)`, then no `k`-digit number can equal its digit-fifth-power sum.

Check:
- `6 * 9^5 = 6 * 59049 = 354294` (still a 6-digit range is possible)
- `7 * 9^5 = 413343 < 1,000,000 = 10^6` ⇒ impossible for 7 digits or more

So we only need to test `n` from `2` up to `354294`.

## Approach
1. Precompute `d^5` for digits `0..9`.
2. For each `n` in `[2, 354294]`, compute the sum of digit fifth powers and compare to `n`.
3. Sum all matching numbers.

This runs quickly because the search space is only ~354k numbers.
