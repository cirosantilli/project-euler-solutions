# Counting Summations (Integer Partitions)

We need the number of ways to write `100` as a sum of **at least two** positive integers where **order doesn’t matter** (partitions).

## Key Insight
This is the partition count `p(100)` **excluding** the single-term partition `[100]`.  
Equivalently, count partitions of `100` using allowed parts `1..99`.

## DP Approach (Coin-Change Style)
Let `dp[s]` be the number of ways to form sum `s` using parts up to the current part size.
- Initialize `dp[0] = 1`.
- For each `part` from `1` to `n-1`, update:
  - `dp[s] += dp[s - part]` for `s = part .. n`

This counts each partition exactly once (by building sums with nondecreasing parts).

## Result
The program computes and prints the answer for `n = 100`, which is `190569291`.
