# Largest Palindrome Product (3-digit factors)

We need the largest palindromic number that can be written as a product of two 3-digit integers (100–999).

## Key ideas
- A number is a palindrome if its decimal representation equals its reverse.
- Search factor pairs in descending order so we find large products first.
- **Pruning**:
  - For a fixed `a`, if `a * 999` is already below the best palindrome found, no smaller `a` can improve it.
  - For a fixed `a`, as `b` decreases the product decreases; once `a*b <= best`, we stop that inner loop.
- When scanning `b` downward, the first palindrome found for that `a` is the largest for that `a`, so we can break early.

This reduces unnecessary checks and runs quickly in Python/PyPy.
