Add asserts for the test cases given in the problem statement if any, and a print with the final result at the end. Your code must run in a few minutes at most, usually a few seconds. Don't try to brute force the solution, only use brute forcing if needed to better understand the problem on small instances. Don't use external libraries, only the Python standard library. Don't use multithreading, only a single CPU core. Use typing for function signatures.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n\nmain.py\n\n<Python implementation>\n\nREADME.md\n\n<Markdown summary of the reasoning/insights used (high level; no chain-of-thought)>\n\nPROBLEM\n\n# Highly Divisible Triangular Number\n\nThe sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers. So the $7$th triangle number would be $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28$. The first ten terms would be:\n$$1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, \\dots$$\n\nLet us list the factors of the first seven triangle numbers:\n\n$$\\begin{align}\n\\mathbf 1 &\\colon 1\\\\\n\\mathbf 3 &\\colon 1,3\\\\\n\\mathbf 6 &\\colon 1,2,3,6\\\\\n\\mathbf{10} &\\colon 1,2,5,10\\\\\n\\mathbf{15} &\\colon 1,3,5,15\\\\\n\\mathbf{21} &\\colon 1,3,7,21\\\\\n\\mathbf{28} &\\colon 1,2,4,7,14,28\n\\end{align}$$\n\nWe can see that $28$ is the first triangle number to have over five divisors.\n\nWhat is the value of the first triangle number to have over five hundred divisors?\n",
