# Project Euler 983 - approach summary

The solver uses the same constructive family that was validated in the previous rollout:

- Pick `k` vectors from opposite lattice-point pairs on the circle `x^2 + y^2 = m`.
- Build circle centers as all even subset sums of those vectors.
- This gives exactly `2^(k-1)` circles.
- For the target (`n >= 500`), we use `k = 10`, so we search for a perfect `512`-circle set.

For each candidate radius-square `m`, the code:

1. Enumerates opposite pairs of lattice vectors on the circle.
2. Enumerates `k` chosen pairs and orientations (with one global-sign symmetry removed).
3. Builds the `512` centers.
4. Runs a fast harmony-point count with early exit.
5. If the fast count matches `512`, runs strict validation:
   - no tangencies,
   - exactly `512` unique harmony points,
   - graph connectivity.

The two statement checks are asserted directly by search:

- `R(2)^2 = 1` via `k = 2`
- `R(4)^2 = 5` via `k = 3`

To keep runtime practical in Python/PyPy for `k = 10`, the search uses the same narrowed candidate family from the rollout (`p in {k, k+2}` and unit-coordinate presence among circle lattice points), then validates any hit strictly.
