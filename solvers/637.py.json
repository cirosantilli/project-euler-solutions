Add asserts for the test cases given in the problem statement if any, and a print with the final result at the end. Your code must run in a few minutes at most, usually a few seconds. Don't try to brute force the solution, only use brute forcing if needed to better understand the problem on small instances. The python file must be fully self contained. Don't use external libraries, only the Python standard library. Don't use multithreading, only a single CPU core. Use typing for function signatures. Also produce a markdown file solvers/637.md summarizing the main ideas used. Any known final answer must not appear anywhere in the generated files, not even comments, don't assert that value, only print it. Ensure that \"./test.py 637\" passes with correct answer 49000634845039. You MUST make that test pass, if that would take too long then you MUST find a more efficient algorithm.\n\nPROBLEM\n\n# Flexible Digit Sum\n\nGiven any positive integer $n$, we can construct a new integer by inserting plus signs between some of the digits of the base $B$ representation of $n$, and then carrying out the additions.\n\nFor example, from $n=123\\_{10}$ ($n$ in base $10$) we can construct the four base $10$ integers $123\\_{10}$, $1+23=24\\_{10}$, $12+3=15\\_{10}$ and $1+2+3=6\\_{10}$.\n\nLet $f(n,B)$ be the smallest number of steps needed to arrive at a single-digit number in base $B$. For example, $f(7,10)=0$ and $f(123,10)=1$.\n\nLet $g(n,B\\_1,B\\_2)$ be the sum of the positive integers $i$ not exceeding $n$ such that $f(i,B\\_1)=f(i,B\\_2)$.\n\nYou are given $g(100,10,3)=3302$.\n\nFind $g(10^7,10,3)$.",
