# Project Euler 469 Solution - Empty Chairs

## Key idea

The seating process is exactly the **random greedy algorithm for a maximal independent set** on a cycle graph with `N` vertices:

- each occupied chair forbids its two neighbors,
- each step chooses uniformly among currently allowed chairs,
- the process ends in a **maximal** (not maximum) independent set.

In statistical-physics language, this is **random sequential adsorption (RSA)** on a 1D lattice with **nearest-neighbor exclusion**.

## Why `N = 10^18` becomes easy

For long 1D systems, RSA has a known *exact* limiting (“jamming”) density:

- occupied fraction → `(1 - e^{-2}) / 2`
- therefore empty fraction → `1 - (1 - e^{-2}) / 2 = (1 + e^{-2}) / 2`

Finite-size effects for a large cycle are only **boundary / wrap-around effects**, which scale like `O(1/N)`.  
At `N = 10^18` this is astronomically smaller than `10^{-14}`, so the problem’s requested rounding is the same as the limit.

So we compute:

\[
E(10^{18}) = \frac{1 + e^{-2}}{2}
\]

and round to 14 decimal places.

## Built-in verification (tests)

The code also implements the standard 2-term recurrence for the circular table expectation (using exact rational arithmetic) and asserts the two values given in the statement:

- `E(4) = 1/2`
- `E(6) = 5/9`

These are quick sanity checks that the model and recurrence match the problem.
