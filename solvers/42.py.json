Add asserts for the test cases given in the problem statement if any, and a print with the final result at the end. Your code must run in a few minutes at most, usually a few seconds. Don't try to brute force the solution, only use brute forcing if needed to better understand the problem on small instances. Don't use external libraries, only the Python standard library. Don't use multithreading, only a single CPU core. Use typing for function signatures.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n\nmain.py\n\n<Python implementation>\n\nREADME.md\n\n<Markdown summary of the reasoning/insights used (high level; no chain-of-thought)>\n\nPROBLEM\n\n# Coded Triangle Numbers\n\nThe $n$th term of the sequence of triangle numbers is given by, $t\\_n = \\frac12n(n+1)$; so the first ten triangle numbers are:\n$$1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, \\dots$$\n\nBy converting each letter in a word to a number corresponding to its alphabetical position and adding these values we form a word value. For example, the word value for SKY is $19 + 11 + 25 = 55 = t\\_{10}$. If the word value is a triangle number then we shall call the word a triangle word.\n\nUsing [words.txt](resources/documents/0042_words.txt) (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 16K text file containing nearly two-thousand common English words, how many are triangle words?\n",
