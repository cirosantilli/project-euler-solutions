Add asserts for the test cases given in the problem statement if any, and a print with the final result at the end. Your code must run in a few minutes at most, usually a few seconds. Don't try to brute force the solution, only use brute forcing if needed to better understand the problem on small instances. Don't use external libraries, only the Python standard library. Don't use multithreading, only a single CPU core. Use typing for function signatures.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n\nmain.py\n\n<Python implementation>\n\nREADME.md\n\n<Markdown summary of the reasoning/insights used (high level; no chain-of-thought)>\n\nPROBLEM\n\n# Ordered Fractions\n\nConsider the fraction, $\\dfrac n d$, where $n$ and $d$ are positive integers. If $n \\lt d$ and $\\operatorname{HCF}(n,d)=1$, it is called a reduced proper fraction.\n\nIf we list the set of reduced proper fractions for $d \\le 8$ in ascending order of size, we get:\n$$\\frac 1 8, \\frac 1 7, \\frac 1 6, \\frac 1 5, \\frac 1 4, \\frac 2 7, \\frac 1 3, \\frac 3 8, \\mathbf{\\frac 2 5}, \\frac 3 7, \\frac 1 2, \\frac 4 7, \\frac 3 5, \\frac 5 8, \\frac 2 3, \\frac 5 7, \\frac 3 4, \\frac 4 5, \\frac 5 6, \\frac 6 7, \\frac 7 8$$\n\nIt can be seen that $\\dfrac 2 5$ is the fraction immediately to the left of $\\dfrac 3 7$.\n\nBy listing the set of reduced proper fractions for $d \\le 1\\,000\\,000$ in ascending order of size, find the numerator of the fraction immediately to the left of $\\dfrac 3 7$.\n",
