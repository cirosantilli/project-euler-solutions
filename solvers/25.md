# Project Euler 25 Solution - $1000$-digit Fibonacci Number

<https://projecteuler.net/problem=25>:

* [25.py](25.py)

We need the first index `n` for which the Fibonacci number `F_n` contains 1000 decimal digits.

### Key idea
The index is small enough (only a few thousand) that we can directly generate Fibonacci numbers using Python's built-in arbitrary-precision integers:

- Start from `F_1 = 1`, `F_2 = 1`
- Repeatedly update `(F_{n-1}, F_n) -> (F_n, F_{n-1} + F_n)`
- Stop when `len(str(F_n)) >= target_digits`

This takes only a few thousand iterations for 1000 digits.

### Complexity
- Time: `O(n)` additions of big integers (here `n ≈ 4782`)
- Space: `O(1)` aside from the size of the integers themselves

The program includes small asserts (e.g., first 3-digit Fibonacci is `F_12`) and prints the final answer.
