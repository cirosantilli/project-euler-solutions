Add asserts for the test cases given in the problem statement if any, and a print with the final result at the end. Your code must run in a few minutes at most, usually a few seconds. Don't try to brute force the solution, only use brute forcing if needed to better understand the problem on small instances. Don't use external libraries, only the Python standard library. Don't use multithreading, only a single CPU core. Use typing for function signatures. Also produce a markdown file README.md summarizing the main ideas used.\n\nPROBLEM\n\n# Subsequence of Thue-Morse Sequence\n\nThe **Thue-Morse sequence** $\\{T\\_n\\}$ is a binary sequence satisfying:\n\n* $T\\_0 = 0$\n* $T\\_{2n} = T\\_n$\n* $T\\_{2n + 1} = 1 - T\\_n$\n\nThe first several terms of $\\{T\\_n\\}$ are given as follows:  \n$01101001{\\color{red}10010}1101001011001101001\\cdots$\n\nWe define $\\{A\\_n\\}$ as the sorted sequence of integers such that the binary expression of each element appears as a subsequence in $\\{T\\_n\\}$.  \nFor example, the decimal number $18$ is expressed as $10010$ in binary. $10010$ appears in $\\{T\\_n\\}$ ($T\\_8$ to $T\\_{12}$), so $18$ is an element of $\\{A\\_n\\}$.  \nThe decimal number $14$ is expressed as $1110$ in binary. $1110$ never appears in $\\{T\\_n\\}$, so $14$ is not an element of $\\{A\\_n\\}$.\n\nThe first several terms of $\\{A\\_n\\}$ are given as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| $n$ | $0$ | $1$ | $2$ | $3$ | $4$ | $5$ | $6$ | $7$ | $8$ | $9$ | $10$ | $11$ | $12$ | $\\cdots$ |\n| $A\\_n$ | $0$ | $1$ | $2$ | $3$ | $4$ | $5$ | $6$ | $9$ | $10$ | $11$ | $12$ | $13$ | $18$ | $\\cdots$ |\n\nWe can also verify that $A\\_{100} = 3251$ and $A\\_{1000} = 80852364498$.\n\nFind the last $9$ digits of $\\sum \\limits\\_{k = 1}^{18} A\\_{10^k}$.",
