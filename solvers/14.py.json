Add asserts for the test cases given in the problem statement if any, and a print with the final result at the end. Your code must run in a few minutes at most, usually a few seconds. Don't try to brute force the solution, only use brute forcing if needed to better understand the problem on small instances. Don't use external libraries, only the Python standard library. Don't use multithreading, only a single CPU core. Use typing for function signatures.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n\nmain.py\n\n<Python implementation>\n\nREADME.md\n\n<Markdown summary of the reasoning/insights used (high level; no chain-of-thought)>\n\nPROBLEM\n\n# Longest Collatz Sequence\n\nThe following iterative sequence is defined for the set of positive integers:\n\n* $n \\to n/2$ ($n$ is even)\n* $n \\to 3n + 1$ ($n$ is odd)\n\nUsing the rule above and starting with $13$, we generate the following sequence:\n$$13 \\to 40 \\to 20 \\to 10 \\to 5 \\to 16 \\to 8 \\to 4 \\to 2 \\to 1.$$\n\nIt can be seen that this sequence (starting at $13$ and finishing at $1$) contains $10$ terms. Although it has not been proved yet (Collatz Problem), it is thought that all starting numbers finish at $1$.\n\nWhich starting number, under one million, produces the longest chain?\n\n**NOTE:** Once the chain starts the terms are allowed to go above one million.\n",
