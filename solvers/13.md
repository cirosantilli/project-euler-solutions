# Large Sum (first 10 digits)

We are given 100 numbers of 50 digits each and need the first 10 digits of their sum.

## Key insight
Python integers have arbitrary precision, so we can:
1. Parse each 50-digit string into an `int`
2. Sum them exactly using normal integer addition
3. Convert the total back to a string and take the first 10 characters

This is efficient because there are only 100 numbers, and big-integer addition on ~50-digit values is very fast.

The program includes an `assert` for the known correct output for this specific input.
