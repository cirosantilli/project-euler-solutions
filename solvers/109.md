# Project Euler 109 Solution - Darts

<https://projecteuler.net/problem=109>:

* [109.py](109.py)

We need the number of *distinct checkout combinations* with total score less than 100, under standard darts scoring with these rules:

- A checkout uses **at most 3 darts**.
- The **final dart must be a double** (including double bull, D25 = 50).
- The first two darts (if used) are **unordered**: e.g. `S1 T1 D1` is the same as `T1 S1 D1`.
- Misses are **not included** as separate outcomes, so `D3` is the same as `0 D3` and `0 0 D3`.

### Approach

1. Enumerate all possible single-dart outcomes (by *identity*, not just score):
   - Singles `S1..S20` and `S25`
   - Doubles `D1..D20` and `D25`
   - Trebles `T1..T20`

2. Enumerate all possible finishing doubles (`D1..D20`, `D25`) as the last dart.

3. For each finishing double `d`, count valid combinations:
   - 1 dart: `[d]`
   - 2 darts: `[x, d]` for any throw `x`
   - 3 darts: `[x, y, d]` where `{x, y}` is an unordered multiset (implemented by iterating indices `i <= j`)

4. Sum combinations whose total score is `< 100`.

### Validation

The program includes asserts from the statement:
- Score 6 has exactly **11** checkout combinations.
- Total number of checkout combinations for all possible checkout scores (up to 170) is **42336**, so counting totals `< 171` matches this.
