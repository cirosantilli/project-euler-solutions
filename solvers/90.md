We must count distinct (unordered) pairs of 6-digit cubes that can display all 2-digit square numbers below 100:
01, 04, 09, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81.

Key observations:
- Each cube is a set of 6 distinct digits from 0..9, so there are only C(10,6)=210 possible cubes.
- Digits 6 and 9 are interchangeable by rotation; for checking displayability we treat any cube containing 6 or 9 as containing **both**.
- A square `XY` is displayable if one cube has X and the other has Y (either orientation).

Algorithm:
1. Enumerate all 210 cubes as bitmasks.
2. Expand each mask so that presence of 6 or 9 implies presence of both.
3. For every unordered pair of cubes (i ≤ j), test all required square digit-pairs.
4. Count pairs that satisfy all squares.

This runs very fast because there are only 210·211/2 = 22,155 cube pairs to check.
The computed answer is `1217`.
