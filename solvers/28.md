# Number Spiral Diagonals (1001×1001)

We build a clockwise number spiral starting from `1` at the center. For any odd `n×n` spiral, the diagonal sum can be computed without constructing the grid.

## Key observation: work layer by layer
Let `k = 1, 2, ...` index the square “layers” around the center:
- Layer `k` has side length `s = 2k + 1`
- The top-right corner is `s²`
- Moving around the corners decreases by steps of `(s - 1)`

So the four corners are:
- `s²`
- `s² - (s - 1)`
- `s² - 2(s - 1)`
- `s² - 3(s - 1)`

Their sum is:
```
4s² - 6(s - 1)
```
Substituting `s = 2k + 1` gives the layer contribution:
```
16k² + 4k + 4
```

## Final formula
Let `m = (n - 1) / 2` be the number of layers. Then:
```
Sum = 1 + Σ_{k=1..m} (16k² + 4k + 4)
```
Using standard sums for `k` and `k²`, this is computed in O(1) time.

The program includes asserts for the sample `5×5 → 101` and prints the result for `1001×1001`.
