# Project Euler 45 Solution - Triangular, Pentagonal, and Hexagonal

* [45.py](45.py)

Key observations:

- Hexagonal numbers satisfy `H_n = n(2n−1)`.
- Every hexagonal number is also triangular because `H_n = T_{2n−1}`.
  Therefore, we only need to search hexagonal numbers and test whether they are also pentagonal.

Pentagonal test:

- Pentagonal numbers satisfy `x = n(3n−1)/2`.
- Solving for `n` gives: `n = (1 + sqrt(1 + 24x)) / 6`.
- So `x` is pentagonal iff `1 + 24x` is a perfect square and `(1 + sqrt(1 + 24x))` is divisible by 6.

Algorithm:

- Start from the first hexagonal index after the known solution (`n = 144`).
- For each `H_n`, check if it is pentagonal using the integer-square test above.
- The first match is the answer.

This runs very quickly because it only performs a simple loop with integer arithmetic and `isqrt`.
