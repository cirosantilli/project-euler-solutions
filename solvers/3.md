# Project Euler 3 Solution - Largest Prime Factor

* [3.py](3.py)

## Key idea
To find the largest prime factor of a positive integer `n`, repeatedly divide out its prime factors:

1. Remove all factors of 2.
2. Then try odd divisors `3, 5, 7, ...` up to `sqrt(n)`.
   - Whenever a divisor `d` divides `n`, divide `n` by `d` as many times as possible.
   - Track the largest divisor used.

## Why this works
After dividing out smaller prime factors, the remaining `n` shrinks. Once the loop condition `d*d > n` holds, any remaining `n > 1` must itself be prime (and is the largest prime factor).

## Complexity
Runs in `O(sqrt(n))` trial divisions in the worst case, but is fast here because `n` decreases during factor removal. For `600851475143`, `sqrt(n)` is under 1 million, which runs quickly in PyPy.
