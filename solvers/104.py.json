Add asserts for the test cases given in the problem statement if any, and a print with the final result at the end. Your code must run in a few minutes at most, usually a few seconds. Don't try to brute force the solution, only use brute forcing if needed to better understand the problem on small instances. Don't use external libraries, only the Python standard library. Don't use multithreading, only a single CPU core. Don't take input from stdin nor CLI arguments. If an external file is required sa input for the program, use the basename of the problem statement for it. Use typing for function signatures.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n\nmain.py\n\n<Python implementation>\n\nREADME.md\n\n<Markdown summary of the reasoning/insights used (high level; no chain-of-thought)>\n\nPROBLEM\n\n# Pandigital Fibonacci Ends\n\nThe Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:\n\n> $F\\_n = F\\_{n - 1} + F\\_{n - 2}$, where $F\\_1 = 1$ and $F\\_2 = 1$.\n\nIt turns out that $F\\_{541}$, which contains $113$ digits, is the first Fibonacci number for which the last nine digits are $1$-$9$ pandigital (contain all the digits $1$ to $9$, but not necessarily in order). And $F\\_{2749}$, which contains $575$ digits, is the first Fibonacci number for which the first nine digits are $1$-$9$ pandigital.\n\nGiven that $F\\_k$ is the first Fibonacci number for which the first nine digits AND the last nine digits are $1$-$9$ pandigital, find $k$.\n",
