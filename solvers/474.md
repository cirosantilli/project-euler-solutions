# Last Digits of Divisors

## Main Idea
- Write each divisor as `2^a * 5^b * y` with `gcd(y,10)=1`.
- Match `2^a` and `5^b` against the required last digits (`10^k` modulus).
- Once `a,b` are fixed, the condition becomes a congruence on `y` modulo `2^{k-a} * 5^{k-b}`.
- Count divisors `y` of `n!` with residue constraints by dynamic programming over the unit group
  `U(2^u) x U(5^v)`, using the fact that all primes `!=2,5` are invertible modulo that modulus.

## DP Sketch
- For every prime `p != 2,5`, its exponent in `n!` is `E`.
- The contribution of `p` is the geometric series `1 + p + p^2 + ... + p^E` in the group.
- We maintain DP over group elements, using the cycle length of `p` in the group to avoid iterating
  `E` times when `E` is large.

## Output
- The program evaluates the two sample assertions and prints
  `F(10^6!, 65432) mod (10^16 + 61)`.
