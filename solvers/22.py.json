Add asserts for the test cases given in the problem statement if any, and a print with the final result at the end. Your code must run in a few minutes at most, usually a few seconds. Don't try to brute force the solution, only use brute forcing if needed to better understand the problem on small instances. Don't use external libraries, only the Python standard library. Don't use multithreading, only a single CPU core. Use typing for function signatures.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n\nmain.py\n\n<Python implementation>\n\nREADME.md\n\n<Markdown summary of the reasoning/insights used (high level; no chain-of-thought)>\n\nPROBLEM\n\n# Names Scores\n\nUsing [names.txt](resources/documents/0022_names.txt) (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 46K text file containing over five-thousand first names, begin by sorting it into alphabetical order. Then working out the alphabetical value for each name, multiply this value by its alphabetical position in the list to obtain a name score.\n\nFor example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order, COLIN, which is worth $3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53$, is the $938$th name in the list. So, COLIN would obtain a score of $938 \\times 53 = 49714$.\n\nWhat is the total of all the name scores in the file?\n",
