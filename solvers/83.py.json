Add asserts for the test cases given in the problem statement if any, and a print with the final result at the end. Your code must run in a few minutes at most, usually a few seconds. Don't try to brute force the solution, only use brute forcing if needed to better understand the problem on small instances. Don't use external libraries, only the Python standard library. Don't use multithreading, only a single CPU core. Use typing for function signatures.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n\nmain.py\n\n<Python implementation>\n\nREADME.md\n\n<Markdown summary of the reasoning/insights used (high level; no chain-of-thought)>\n\nPROBLEM\n\n# Path Sum: Four Ways\n\nNOTE: This problem is a significantly more challenging version of [Problem 81](problem=81).\n\nIn the $5$ by $5$ matrix below, the minimal path sum from the top left to the bottom right, by moving left, right, up, and down, is indicated in bold red and is equal to $2297$.\n\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\color{red}{131} & 673 & \\color{red}{234} & \\color{red}{103} & \\color{red}{18}\\\\\n\\color{red}{201} & \\color{red}{96} & \\color{red}{342} & 965 & \\color{red}{150}\\\\\n630 & 803 & 746 & \\color{red}{422} & \\color{red}{111}\\\\\n537 & 699 & 497 & \\color{red}{121} & 956\\\\\n805 & 732 & 524 & \\color{red}{37} & \\color{red}{331}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nFind the minimal path sum from the top left to the bottom right by moving left, right, up, and down in [matrix.txt](resources/documents/0083_matrix.txt) (right click and \"Save Link/Target As...\"), a 31K text file containing an $80$ by $80$ matrix.\n",
