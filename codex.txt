INSTRUCTIONS

Solve the following problem on file solvers/{n}.py. Test on pypy3. Add asserts for the test cases given in the problem statement if any, and a print with the final result at the end. Your code must run in a few minutes at most, usually a few seconds. Don't try to brute force the solution, only use brute forcing if needed to better understand the problem on small instances. The python file must be fully self contained. Don't use external libraries, only the Python standard library. The generated program must not use multithreading, only a single CPU core. The generated program read or write to any files, except to read any input files mentioned in the problem itself, and it cannot use the internet. Use typing for function signatures. Also produce a markdown file solvers/{n}.md summarizing the main ideas used. Any known final answer must not appear anywhere in the generated files, not even comments, don't assert that value, only print it. Precomputed intermediate values should also not appear in the code, your code must compute everything that is not readily available in the standard library from scratch. If you fail to find an algorithm that produces the correct solution, DO NOT TRY TO CHEAT by hardcoding it in the output program or reading it from some solution repository, either don't create the python file, or make it clearly throw an exception.{expect}
