Add asserts for the test cases given in the problem statement if any, and a print with the final result at the end. Your code must run in a few minutes at most, usually a few seconds. Don't try to brute force the solution, only use brute forcing if needed to better understand the problem on small instances. Don't use external libraries, only the Python standard library. Don't use multithreading, only a single CPU core. Don't take input from stdin nor CLI arguments. If an external file is required sa input for the program, use the basename of the problem statement for it. Use typing for function signatures.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n\nmain.py\n\n<Python implementation>\n\nREADME.md\n\n<Markdown summary of the reasoning/insights used (high level; no chain-of-thought)>\n\nPROBLEM\n\n# Diophantine Reciprocals I\n\nIn the following equation $x$, $y$, and $n$ are positive integers.\n\n$$\\dfrac{1}{x} + \\dfrac{1}{y} = \\dfrac{1}{n}$$\n\nFor $n = 4$ there are exactly three distinct solutions:\n\n$$\\begin{align}\n\\dfrac{1}{5} + \\dfrac{1}{20} &= \\dfrac{1}{4}\\\\\n\\dfrac{1}{6} + \\dfrac{1}{12} &= \\dfrac{1}{4}\\\\\n\\dfrac{1}{8} + \\dfrac{1}{8} &= \\dfrac{1}{4}\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nWhat is the least value of $n$ for which the number of distinct solutions exceeds one-thousand?\n\nNOTE: This problem is an easier version of [Problem 110](problem=110); it is strongly advised that you solve this one first.\n",
