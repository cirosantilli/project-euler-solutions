# Project Euler 55 Solution - Lychrel Numbers

We iterate the "reverse and add" process for each number `n` below 10,000:

1. Start with `x = n`.
2. Repeat up to 50 times:
   - Compute `x = x + reverse(x)`.
   - If `x` becomes a palindrome, then `n` is **not** considered a Lychrel number (it is "proven otherwise").
3. If no palindrome appears within 50 iterations, we count `n` as a Lychrel number (per the problem's assumption).

Important detail: even if `n` itself is palindromic (e.g., 4994), we still apply the process starting with the first reverse-and-add step; the initial number being a palindrome does not automatically disqualify it.

Python's arbitrary-precision integers handle the growth in value easily for these bounds, so the solution is straightforward and fast.
