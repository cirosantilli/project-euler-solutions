Add asserts for the test cases given in the problem statement if any, and a print with the final result at the end. Your code must run in a few minutes at most, usually a few seconds. Don't try to brute force the solution, only use brute forcing if needed to better understand the problem on small instances. Don't use external libraries, only the Python standard library. Don't use multithreading, only a single CPU core. Use typing for function signatures.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n\nmain.py\n\n<Python implementation>\n\nREADME.md\n\n<Markdown summary of the reasoning/insights used (high level; no chain-of-thought)>\n\nPROBLEM\n\n# Sub-string Divisibility\n\nThe number, $1406357289$, is a $0$ to $9$ pandigital number because it is made up of each of the digits $0$ to $9$ in some order, but it also has a rather interesting sub-string divisibility property.\n\nLet $d\\_1$ be the $1$st digit, $d\\_2$ be the $2$nd digit, and so on. In this way, we note the following:\n\n* $d\\_2d\\_3d\\_4=406$ is divisible by $2$\n* $d\\_3d\\_4d\\_5=063$ is divisible by $3$\n* $d\\_4d\\_5d\\_6=635$ is divisible by $5$\n* $d\\_5d\\_6d\\_7=357$ is divisible by $7$\n* $d\\_6d\\_7d\\_8=572$ is divisible by $11$\n* $d\\_7d\\_8d\\_9=728$ is divisible by $13$\n* $d\\_8d\\_9d\\_{10}=289$ is divisible by $17$\n\nFind the sum of all $0$ to $9$ pandigital numbers with this property.\n",
