# Project Euler 62 Solution - Cubic Permutations

* [62.py](62.py)

We need the smallest cube such that **exactly five** permutations of its digits are also cubes.

## Key idea
Two numbers are digit-permutations of each other iff they have the same **digit multiset**.  
So we map each cube to a **signature**: counts of digits 0–9 (a 10-tuple).

All cubes sharing a signature are permutations of one another.

## Efficient search
Cubes with different digit-lengths can never be permutations of each other, so we process cubes grouped by digit-length:

- Iterate `n = 1, 2, 3, ...`, compute `n^3`.
- Compute its digit signature and count how many cubes share it for the current digit-length.
- When the cube digit-length increases, finalize the previous length:
  - If any signature occurred exactly `k` times, the smallest cube in those groups is the answer.
  - Otherwise, clear the dictionary and continue with the new length.

The first digit-length that contains a valid group yields the global minimum, since cube values strictly grow with digit-length.

## Result
The smallest cube with exactly five cube-permutations is:
`127035954683` (which equals `5027^3`).
