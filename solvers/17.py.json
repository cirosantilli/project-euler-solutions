Add asserts for the test cases given in the problem statement if any, and a print with the final result at the end. Your code must run in a few minutes at most, usually a few seconds. Don't try to brute force the solution, only use brute forcing if needed to better understand the problem on small instances. Don't use external libraries, only the Python standard library. Don't use multithreading, only a single CPU core. Use typing for function signatures.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n\nmain.py\n\n<Python implementation>\n\nREADME.md\n\n<Markdown summary of the reasoning/insights used (high level; no chain-of-thought)>\n\nPROBLEM\n\n# Number Letter Counts\n\nIf the numbers $1$ to $5$ are written out in words: one, two, three, four, five, then there are $3 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 4 = 19$ letters used in total.\n\nIf all the numbers from $1$ to $1000$ (one thousand) inclusive were written out in words, how many letters would be used?\n\n  \n\n**NOTE:** Do not count spaces or hyphens. For example, $342$ (three hundred and forty-two) contains $23$ letters and $115$ (one hundred and fifteen) contains $20$ letters. The use of \"and\" when writing out numbers is in compliance with British usage.\n",
