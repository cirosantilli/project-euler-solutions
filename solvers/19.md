We track the weekday of the **first day of each month**, starting from the given anchor:

- 1 Jan 1900 is a Monday.

For each month from Jan 1900 through Dec 2000:
1. If the year is within **1901..2000** and the weekday is Sunday, increment the count.
2. Advance the weekday for the next month by adding the number of days in the current month modulo 7.

Month lengths follow the standard rule, with February adjusted by the leap year rule:
- divisible by 4 → leap year,
- except divisible by 100 → not leap,
- except divisible by 400 → leap.

This runs in constant time (only 1212 months processed) and prints the final answer.
