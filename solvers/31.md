# Coin Sums (UK £2)

We need the number of **combinations** (order does not matter) to make 200p using UK coins:
`[1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200]`.

## Key idea: 1D dynamic programming (unbounded knapsack, combinations)
Let `dp[s]` be the number of ways to form sum `s` using coins processed so far.

- Initialize `dp[0] = 1` (one way to form 0: choose nothing).
- For each coin `c`, update sums from `c` to `target`:
  - `dp[s] += dp[s - c]`

Iterating coins in the outer loop ensures each combination is counted once (no permutations).

## Complexity
- Time: `O(target * number_of_coins)` = `200 * 8` operations (very fast)
- Space: `O(target)` = 201 integers

The computed answer for 200p is **73682**.
