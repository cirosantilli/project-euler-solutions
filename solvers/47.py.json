Add asserts for the test cases given in the problem statement if any, and a print with the final result at the end. Your code must run in a few minutes at most, usually a few seconds. Don't try to brute force the solution, only use brute forcing if needed to better understand the problem on small instances. Don't use external libraries, only the Python standard library. Don't use multithreading, only a single CPU core. Use typing for function signatures.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n\nmain.py\n\n<Python implementation>\n\nREADME.md\n\n<Markdown summary of the reasoning/insights used (high level; no chain-of-thought)>\n\nPROBLEM\n\n# Distinct Primes Factors\n\nThe first two consecutive numbers to have two distinct prime factors are:\n\n$$\\begin{align}\n14 &= 2 \\times 7\\\\\n15 &= 3 \\times 5.\n\\end{align}$$\n\nThe first three consecutive numbers to have three distinct prime factors are:\n\n$$\\begin{align}\n644 &= 2^2 \\times 7 \\times 23\\\\\n645 &= 3 \\times 5 \\times 43\\\\\n646 &= 2 \\times 17 \\times 19.\n\\end{align}$$\n\nFind the first four consecutive integers to have four distinct prime factors each.
