Add asserts for the test cases given in the problem statement if any, and a print with the final result at the end. Your code must run in a few minutes at most, usually a few seconds. Don't try to brute force the solution, only use brute forcing if needed to better understand the problem on small instances. Don't use external libraries, only the Python standard library. Don't use multithreading, only a single CPU core. Don't take input from stdin nor CLI arguments. If an external file is required sa input for the program, use the basename of the problem statement for it. Use typing for function signatures.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n\nmain.py\n\n<Python implementation>\n\nREADME.md\n\n<Markdown summary of the reasoning/insights used (high level; no chain-of-thought)>\n\nPROBLEM\n\n# Triangle Containment\n\nThree distinct points are plotted at random on a Cartesian plane, for which $-1000 \\le x, y \\le 1000$, such that a triangle is formed.\n\nConsider the following two triangles:\n\n$$\\begin{gather}\nA(-340,495), B(-153,-910), C(835,-947)\\\\\nX(-175,41), Y(-421,-714), Z(574,-645)\n\\end{gather}$$\n\nIt can be verified that triangle $ABC$ contains the origin, whereas triangle $XYZ$ does not.\n\nUsing [triangles.txt](../documents/0102_triangles.txt) (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 27K text file containing the co-ordinates of one thousand \"random\" triangles, find the number of triangles for which the interior contains the origin.\n\nNOTE: The first two examples in the file represent the triangles in the example given above.\n",
