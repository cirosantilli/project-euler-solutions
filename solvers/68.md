# Project Euler 68 Solution - Magic 5-gon Ring

<https://projecteuler.net/problem=68>:

* [68.py](68.py)

We need the maximum 16-digit concatenation describing a “magic” 5‑gon ring using numbers 1..10.

### Key insights

- The ring consists of 5 lines: `(outer[i], inner[i], inner[i+1])` (cyclic indices), all summing to the same value `S`.
- The concatenated string is defined by starting at the line with the **smallest outer node** and reading **clockwise**.
- To get a **16-digit** string (not 17), the number **10 must be on the outer ring**, because inner nodes are used twice in the concatenation.

### Deriving the line sum `S`

Let `sum(inner) = I`. Then `sum(outer) = 55 - I`.

Across the 5 lines:
- Total of all line sums = `5*S`
- This equals `sum(outer) + 2*sum(inner)` because each inner node appears in two lines.

So:
`5*S = (55 - I) + 2I = 55 + I`, hence  
`S = (55 + I) / 5`.

This means `S` is determined solely by the chosen inner set, and it must be an integer.

### Algorithm

1. Choose 5 inner numbers from `{1..9}` (so 10 is forced outer).
2. Compute `S = (55 + sum(inner)) / 5`; skip if non-integer.
3. For each of the `5!` cyclic orders (permutations) of the inner nodes:
   - Compute each outer node as `outer[i] = S - inner[i] - inner[i+1]`.
   - Check that the resulting 5 outer nodes are exactly the remaining numbers and all distinct.
   - Rotate the representation to start at the smallest outer node.
   - Concatenate into a string and track the maximum among 16-digit strings.

The search space is small: `C(9,5) * 5! = 126 * 120 = 15120` cases.

### Result

The program prints (and asserts) the known maximum 16-digit string:

`6531031914842725`
