Add asserts for the test cases given in the problem statement if any, and a print with the final result at the end. Your code must run in a few minutes at most, usually a few seconds. Don't try to brute force the solution, only use brute forcing if needed to better understand the problem on small instances. Don't use external libraries, only the Python standard library. Don't use multithreading, only a single CPU core. Don't take input from stdin nor CLI arguments. If an external file is required sa input for the program, use the basename of the problem statement for it. Use typing for function signatures.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n\nmain.py\n\n<Python implementation>\n\nREADME.md\n\n<Markdown summary of the reasoning/insights used (high level; no chain-of-thought)>\n\nPROBLEM\n\n# Special Subset Sums: Meta-testing\n\nLet $S(A)$ represent the sum of elements in set $A$ of size $n$. We shall call it a special sum set if for any two non-empty disjoint subsets, $B$ and $C$, the following properties are true:\n\n1. $S(B) \\ne S(C)$; that is, sums of subsets cannot be equal.\n2. If $B$ contains more elements than $C$ then $S(B) \\gt S(C)$.\n\nFor this problem we shall assume that a given set contains $n$ strictly increasing elements and it already satisfies the second rule.\n\nSurprisingly, out of the $25$ possible subset pairs that can be obtained from a set for which $n = 4$, only $1$ of these pairs need to be tested for equality (first rule). Similarly, when $n = 7$, only $70$ out of the $966$ subset pairs need to be tested.\n\nFor $n = 12$, how many of the $261625$ subset pairs that can be obtained need to be tested for equality?\n\nNOTE: This problem is related to [Problem 103](problem=103) and [Problem 105](problem=105).\n",
