Add asserts for the test cases given in the problem statement if any, and a print with the final result at the end. Your code must run in a few minutes at most, usually a few seconds. Don't try to brute force the solution, only use brute forcing if needed to better understand the problem on small instances. Don't use external libraries, only the Python standard library. Don't use multithreading, only a single CPU core. Use typing for function signatures.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n\nmain.py\n\n<Python implementation>\n\nREADME.md\n\n<Markdown summary of the reasoning/insights used (high level; no chain-of-thought)>\n\nPROBLEM\n\n# Totient Permutation\n\nEuler's totient function, $\\phi(n)$ [sometimes called the phi function], is used to determine the number of positive numbers less than or equal to $n$ which are relatively prime to $n$. For example, as $1, 2, 4, 5, 7$, and $8$, are all less than nine and relatively prime to nine, $\\phi(9)=6$.  \nThe number $1$ is considered to be relatively prime to every positive number, so $\\phi(1)=1$.\n\nInterestingly, $\\phi(87109)=79180$, and it can be seen that $87109$ is a permutation of $79180$.\n\nFind the value of $n$, $1 \\lt n \\lt 10^7$, for which $\\phi(n)$ is a permutation of $n$ and the ratio $n/\\phi(n)$ produces a minimum.\n",
