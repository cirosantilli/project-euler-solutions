# Project Euler 79 Solution - Passcode Derivation

* [79.py](79.py)

Each successful login attempt is a 3-digit string `abc` meaning:

- `a` appears before `b`
- `b` appears before `c`

These are precedence constraints. Collect all digits that appear, build a directed graph with edges for each constraint (e.g., `a -> b`, `b -> c`), and then compute a **topological ordering** of this graph.

Because the passcode must include each used digit at least once and must respect all ordering constraints, the shortest possible passcode is exactly the digits in a valid topological order (one occurrence per unique digit). The provided solution uses Kahn’s algorithm (indegree-based topological sort) with a heap for deterministic output.
