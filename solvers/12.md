We seek the first triangular number  
\(T_n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}\)  
with more than 500 divisors.

### Key insights

1. **Coprimality of consecutive integers**  
   \(\gcd(n, n+1) = 1\).  
   Since \(T_n\) divides by 2, we rewrite:
   - If \(n\) is even: \(T_n = (n/2)\cdot(n+1)\)
   - If \(n\) is odd:  \(T_n = n\cdot((n+1)/2)\)

   In both cases the two factors are coprime, so:
   \[
   d(T_n) = d(a)\cdot d(b)
   \]
   where \(d(x)\) is the number of divisors of \(x\).

2. **Divisor counting via prime factorization**  
   If \(m = \prod p_i^{e_i}\), then:
   \[
   d(m) = \prod (e_i + 1)
   \]
   We compute this by trial division using a growing list of primes.

3. **Incremental search over n**  
   Iterate \(n = 1,2,3,\dots\), compute \(d(T_n)\) using the coprime split, and stop
   when it exceeds the threshold.

### Result

The program prints the first triangular number with more than 500 divisors:
`76576500`.

An assertion is included for the example in the statement:
the first triangular number with more than 5 divisors is `28`.
