Add asserts for the test cases given in the problem statement if any, and a print with the final result at the end. Your code must run in a few minutes at most, usually a few seconds. Don't try to brute force the solution, only use brute forcing if needed to better understand the problem on small instances. Don't use external libraries, only the Python standard library. Don't use multithreading, only a single CPU core. Use typing for function signatures.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n\nmain.py\n\n<Python implementation>\n\nREADME.md\n\n<Markdown summary of the reasoning/insights used (high level; no chain-of-thought)>\n\nPROBLEM\n\n# Reciprocal Cycles\n\nA unit fraction contains $1$ in the numerator. The decimal representation of the unit fractions with denominators $2$ to $10$ are given:\n\n$$\\begin{align}\n1/2 &= 0.5\\\\\n1/3 &=0.(3)\\\\\n1/4 &=0.25\\\\\n1/5 &= 0.2\\\\\n1/6 &= 0.1(6)\\\\\n1/7 &= 0.(142857)\\\\\n1/8 &= 0.125\\\\\n1/9 &= 0.(1)\\\\\n1/10 &= 0.1\n\\end{align}$$\n\nWhere $0.1(6)$ means $0.166666\\cdots$, and has a $1$-digit recurring cycle. It can be seen that $1/7$ has a $6$-digit recurring cycle.\n\nFind the value of $d \\lt 1000$ for which $1/d$ contains the longest recurring cycle in its decimal fraction part.\n",
