Add asserts for the test cases given in the problem statement if any, and a print with the final result at the end. Your code must run in a few minutes at most, usually a few seconds. Don't try to brute force the solution, only use brute forcing if needed to better understand the problem on small instances. Don't use external libraries, only the Python standard library. Don't use multithreading, only a single CPU core. Use typing for function signatures.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n\nmain.py\n\n<Python implementation>\n\nREADME.md\n\n<Markdown summary of the reasoning/insights used (high level; no chain-of-thought)>\n\nPROBLEM\n\n# Coin Sums\n\nIn the United Kingdom the currency is made up of pound (\u00a3) and pence (p). There are eight coins in general circulation:\n\n> 1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p, \u00a31 (100p), and \u00a32 (200p).\n\nIt is possible to make \u00a32 in the following way:\n\n> 1\u00d7\u00a31 + 1\u00d750p + 2\u00d720p + 1\u00d75p + 1\u00d72p + 3\u00d71p\n\nHow many different ways can \u00a32 be made using any number of coins?\n",
