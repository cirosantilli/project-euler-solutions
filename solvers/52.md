# Project Euler 52 Solution - Permuted Multiples

* [52.py](52.py)

We need the smallest positive integer `x` such that `2x, 3x, 4x, 5x, 6x` are all digit-permutations of `x`.

## Key observations
- If `x` has `d` digits, then `6x` must also have `d` digits (otherwise the digit multiset cannot match).
- Therefore we can search by digit length `d`, restricting:
  - `x >= 10^(d-1)`
  - `x <= floor((10^d - 1) / 6)`

## Method
For each candidate `x` in the feasible range:
- Compute a **digit signature**: a 10-element tuple counting occurrences of digits `0..9`.
- Check whether `m*x` has the same signature for `m = 2..6`.

The first `x` that satisfies all checks is the answer.

This runs quickly because the search space is small (the solution is `142857`).
